BrightScript debug protocol
The Roku socket-based BrightScript debug protocol enables Roku app development to be tightly integrated into Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). A tight integration helps expedite Roku app development as an IDE could be used to do the following:
Write code using BrightScript syntax-directed editing and highlighting.
Upload and run the app directly to the Roku media player.
Communicate app stops and failures.
Stop a running app.
Inspect variables and stack traces of a stopped app.
Step through a thread.
Insert dynamic breakpoints.
Resume a stopped app (if a fatal error has not occurred in the script).

This protocol may be used in an interactive debugging session. Do not use it for storing data in a static file.
Network Format
The network format of the protocol adheres to the following rules:
Numeric values are sent in little-endian order.
Data types are sent as a network byte stream in little-endian order.
String values are encoded as UTF-8.

Data Type	Definition
binary32float	IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point value
binary64float	IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point value
bool	8-bit unsigned integer (0 = false; nonzero = true)
int8	8-bit signed integer
uint8	8-bit unsigned integer
int32	32-bit signed integer
uint32	32-bit unsigned integer
int64	64-bit signed integer
uint64	64-bit unsigned integer
utf8z	utf-8-encoded character stream terminated with '\0'

The notation used in this specification is similar to C++; however, the protocol describes the network data stream format—it does not define in-memory data structures.
Debugging target startup sequence
After an app is launched with a request to enable remote debugging, the firmware waits for a connection from the remote debugger client. Immediately after a connection is established, an initial handshake is then performed. The handshake consists of the following data being sent by each end of the connection:
struct HandshakeToDVP {    // DVP = Digital Video Player (Roku device)
    uint64 magic_number;   // 0x0067756265647362LU
};

struct HandshakeFromDVP {
    uint64 magic_number
    uint32 protocol_major_version;
    uint32 protocol_minor_version;
    uint32 protocol_patch_version;
    uint32 remaining_packet_length;
    int64  platform_revision_timestamp;
};

Field	Type	Description
magic_number	uint64	The Roku Brightscript debug protocol identifier, which is the following 64-bit value : 0x0067756265647362LU .

This is equal to 29120988069524322LU or the following little-endian value: b'bsdebug\0 .
protocol_major_version
protocol_minor_version
protocol_patch_version	uint32	Each Roku OS release supports only a single version of the Roku Brightscript debug protocol:
Roku OS Supported Debug Protocol Version Roku OS 14.1 3.3.0 Roku OS 12.0 3.2.0 Roku OS 11.5 3.1.0 Roku OS 11.0 3.0.0 Roku OS 9.3, 9.4, 10.0, 10.5 2.0.0 Roku OS 9.2 1.0.1
The debugger client must be updated to the protocol version number or disconnect. A change in the major version number indicates that changes that are not backwards-compatible have been made since the previous release.

Roku OS 9.3, 9.4, 10.0, 10.5	2.0.0
Roku OS 9.2	1.0.1
remaining_packet_length	uint32	The length in bytes of the remaining data, including the remaining_packet_length itself. The debugger client must read this number of bytes.

As of BrightScript debug protocol 3.0.0 (Roku OS 11.0), all packets from the debugging target include a packet_length . The length is always in bytes, and includes the packet_length field, itself.

This field avoids the need for changes to the major version of the protocol because it allows a debugger client to read past data it does not understand and is not critical to debugger operations.

The debug target may intentionally send a packet_length longer than the actual data, with a small number of trailing padding bytes to complete the length. Clients must read the entire packet_length before expecting the next packet.
platform_revision_timestamp	int64	A platform-specific implementation timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch [1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z]).

As of BrightScript debug protocol 3.0.0 (Roku OS 11.0), a timestamp is sent to the debugger client in the initial handshake. This timestamp is platform-specific data that is included in the system software of the platform being debugged. It is changed by the platform's vendor when there is any change that affects the behavior of the debugger.

The value can be used in manners similar to a build number, and is primarily used to differentiate between pre-release builds of the platform being debugged.

The behavior after the handshake has been executed, depends on the version of the BrightScript debug protocol being used:
2.0.0 (and later) : The debug target will immediately stop on the first BrightScript statement in the script and send an ALL_THREADS_STOPPED message. The debugger client (for example, an IDE) may then set dynamic breakpoints in the target before its execution. In all cases, the debugger client must send a CONTINUE command to begin executing BrightScript code.
1.0.1 : The debug target runs immediately after the handshake.

Debugger Request Format
Remote debugging clients can send a debugger request to the debugging target (for example, the script group) using the following packet structure for the network byte stream:
struct DebuggerRequest {
    uint32 packet_length;
    uint32 request_id;
    uint32 command_code;
    uint8 command_arguments;
};

Debugger Update Format
The debugger sends an update message when a state change occurs in the application being debugged, which may or may not have been requested by the debugging client or user. DebuggerUpdate messages have a similar format as DebuggerResponse messages, except that the request_id is always 0 , and it includes an update_type field, which specifies the type of update being sent.

Debugging Commands
The BrightScript debugger supports the following debug commands:
Debug Command	Description	Access Scope	Arguments	Response
STOP	Stop all threads in application. Enter into debugger.

Individual threads can not be stopped/started.	Application is running	none	No response (OK or Error if successful).
CONTINUE	Exit from debugger and continue execution of all threads.	Debugger is active. All threads are stopped	none	DebuggerResponse with no payload (OK or Error if successful).
THREADS	Application threads info	Debugger is active. All threads are stopped.	none	A ThreadsResponse struct.
STACKTRACE	Get the stack trace of a specific thread.	Debugger is active. All threads are stopped.	uint32 thread_index	A StackTraceResponse struct.
VARIABLES	Listing of variables accessible from selected thread and stack frame.	Debugger is active, all thread	variables arguments	A VariablesResponse struct.
STEP	Execute one step on a specified thread.	Debugger is active. All threads are stopped.

As of Roku OS 14.6, you can use the STEP command to step over and out of SceneGraph observer callbacks and functions called via CallFunc .	step arguments	DebuggerResponse with no payload (OK or Error if successful).

If the STEP command is valid, the debugging target responds immediately with an OK response. The specified thread will then detach from the debugger, execute briefly as specified by the step_type parameter, and then re-attach to the debugger.

The re-attachment causes another THREAD_ATTACHED update message to be sent to the debugger client.

Exception Breakpoints
Available since Roku OS 14.1
Exception breakpoints enable developers to pause the debugger whenever a runtime error is encountered or an exception is thrown. Unlike other breakpoints, exception breakpoints do not have an associated source file and line number, and they can not be listed or removed using LIST_BREAKPOINTS or REMOVE_BREAKPOINTS. Clients must use SET_EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINTS to set or clear the active exception breakpoints.

Virtual Variables
Available since Roku OS 14.1
Virtual variables are values that can be retrieved with a VARIABLES request but do not correspond to actual variables (for example, the length of a container). By convention, variables start with a $ character. The following virtual variables are supported:
Object Type	Name	Type	Description
roSGNode	$children	roArray	The SceneGraph children of the given node. This is equivalent to calling node.getChildren(-1, 0) .
roSGNode	$parent	roSGNode	The SceneGraph parent of the given node. This is equivalent to calling node.getParent() .
roSGNode	$threadinfo	roAssociativeArray	The threadInfo of the given node. This is equivalent to calling node.threadInfo() .
Container types	$count	Integer	The number of elements in the container. This is equivalent to calling var.Count() .

Virtual variables are only returned if both GET_VIRTUAL_KEYS and GET_CHILD_KEYS are set in the VARIABLES request. Variable paths may include multiple virtual keys. For example, to get the first grandchild node's thread info, the client can send a request with the following path: node.$children.0.$children.0.$threadinfo .
Sample remote debugger
You can download the Roku Remote Debugger , which is a Python-based sample command-line remote debugger for testing and debugging Roku apps under development. The Roku Remote Debugger ( rokudebug.py ) provides the same functionality as the BrightScript debug console ; however, it demonstrates how the BrightScript network debug protocol could be used to integrate a debug tool into an IDE.
To run the Roku Remote Debugger, follow these steps:
Verify that you have Python 3.5.3 (or greater) installed on your machine.
Create a ZIP file containing the development app to be tested. You can also download sample apps to test with the debugger.
Sideload an app by entering the following command in a terminal or command prompt: python rokudebug.py --targetip <Roku device IP address> --targetpass <Roku device webserver password> <development app zip file> The following example demonstrates a command for running the debugger python3 rokudebug.py --targetip 192.168.1.10 --targetpass abcd VideoListExample/Archive.zip

Enter help to view a list of the available debug commands, which are as follows: Command Abbreviation Description addbreak break, ab Adds a breakpoint backtrace bt Print stack backtrace of selected thread. continue c Continue all threads. down d Move one frame down the function call stack. help h Print the available commands. list l List the currently running function. listbreak Lb List all breakpoints out o Step out of the current function over v Step over one program statement print var Print the value of a specific variable. rmbreak breakpointid rb Clears the specified breakpoint quit q Quit the Roku Remote Debugger and exit the app. status Show the status of the Roku Remote Debugger. step S, t Step one program statement stop Stop all threads. thread th Inspect a thread. threads ths Show all threads. up u Move one frame up the function call stack. vars v Show the variables in the current scope.

[BETA] Visual Studio Code extension
You can download the beta version of the Visual Studio Code extension for the Roku BrightScript debug protocol. After extracting and installing the extension, you can use it for debugging Roku apps in Visual Studio.
Demo video
The following video demonstrates the Roku Remote Debugger , and it shows how the BrightScript network debug protocol could be used in an integration with an IDE such as Visual Studio Code.
Change log
12-28-2024 : Roku Remote debugger 3.3.0 release. DebuggerRequest messages now support a SET_EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINTS debugging command (code 12). DebuggerUpdate messages include the EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT_ERROR (updat_type code 8) command. The Variables debug command now supports requesting "virtual" variables using the GET_VIRTUAL_KEYS flag and VIRTUAL_PATH_INCLUDED keys.
03-06-2023 : Roku Remote debugger 3.2.0 release. Support added for sending ADD_CONDITIONAL_BREAKPOINTS requests while the script is running. DebuggerUpdate messages now include BREAKPOINT_VERIFIED (update_type code 6) and PROTOCOL_ERROR (update_type code 7) commands.
09-12-2022 : Roku Remote debugger 3.1.0 release. DebuggerRequest messages now support an ADD_CONDITIONAL_BREAKPOINTS debugging command (code 11). The LIST_BREAKPOINTS debugging command (code 7) now supports both conditional and non-conditional breakpoints. DebuggerResponse messages now include error_flags and error_data fields if the value returned to the error_code field is not "OK" (error code 0). DebuggerUpdate messages include the following new update_type codes: BREAKPOINT_ERROR (update_type code 4). A compilation or runtime error occurred when evaluating the cond_expr of a conditional breakpoint COMPILE_ERROR (update_type code 5). A compilation error occurred. The Variables debug command now supports a new path_force_case_insensitive flag that forces a case-insensitive lookup of the corresponding path entry when enabled. Enabling this flag also requires the VariablesRequestFlag argument to be set to the new "CASE_SENSITIVITY_OPTIONS" value. This is useful for debugging scripts using "." notation for associative arrays, which is always case insensitive for all object types.
03-22-2022 : Roku Remote debugger 3.0.0 release. The HandshakeFromDVP object, which is sent by a Roku device to a debugger client as part of the initial handshake, includes a new platform_revision_timestamp field that is primarily used to identify the Roku OS version of the device being used for debugging. DebuggerResponse messages include a new packet_length field that enables a debugger client to read past non-essential data that it does not understand. DebuggerUpdate messages include the following new THREAD_DETACHED (error code 6) and EXECUTION_TIMEOUT (error code 7) error_code status and codes:
08-14-2020 : Beta release of Visual Studio Code extension. Updated debug command table.
03-29-2020 : Roku Remote debugger 2.0.0 release. Added breakpoint and step commands.
11-09-2019 : Roku Remote debugger 1.0.1 release.
