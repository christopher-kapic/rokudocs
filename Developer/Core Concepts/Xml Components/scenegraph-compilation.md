SceneGraph compilation
SceneGraph components are compiled as the application is started. All
SceneGraph component files (with the extension *.xml) , and any related
BrightScript files (with the extension *.brs) , in the pkg:/components directory, are compiled.
BrightScript files in the pkg:/components directory are compiled in
the same way as BrightScript files in the pkg:/source directory. The
SceneGraph component files are compiled by creating a list of component
names for the application, based on the name attribute of
the <component> element of each file.
These component names are checked for validity as instances of the
components are created in the application. This check is case-sensitive : the component name to be created must exactly match
a name in the component name list, including case. The application
begins to create instances of SceneGraph components starting with a
component extended from a scene node class (either Scene or OverhangPanelSetScene ). See Component Initialization
Order for a description
of the process that creates component
instances.
There must be only one SceneGraph component extended from a scene
node class in the pkg:/components directory. All component names in an
application should be unique to avoid the possibility of creating an
instance of an unwanted component definition.
