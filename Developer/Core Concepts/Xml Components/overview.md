XML components overview
An XML-based markup language has been added to the SceneGraph API that
allows new SceneGraph components to be defined consisting of a set of
SceneGraph nodes loaded from a declarative description, with interactive
or animated behaviors added using Brightscript, similar to how HTML and
Javascript are used in web development.
Once a XML component has been defined, it can be used just like any of
the built-in SceneGraph node types. For example, if a XML component
named Gizmo has been defined, an instance of the component can be
created by either declaring it in another XML component file:
<Gizmo id="MyGizmo" />

Or using the createObject() function to create an roSGNode object:
createObject("roSGNode", "Gizmo")

Each component XML file defines a top-level <component> XML element that may contain
an <interface> element, zero or more <script> elements, and zero or more
elements defining child SceneGraph nodes.
