Content metadata
Content metadata describes a viewable title that will be shown to the
user. Content may be any supported type of video and the metadata is
used by the UI to format and display the title to the user. Some
attributes (e.g. ContentType) affect how the title is displayed on
screen, other attributes (e.g. SDPosterURL) specify where to fetch
artwork to display with the content and other attributes (e.g. Title)
are just rendered as text.
Overview
The content metadata is stored in an associative array by the script
and provided to the various screen objects as needed for display. In
some cases an array of content metadata may be provided so that the
screen can render multiple items as a list. The attribute names are
critical and used as the key to look up the attribute at run time. The
following table details the attributes in use. Certain attributes are
recognized by particular screens, while others are more globally
applicable. If the attribute is not a generally recognized attribute,
the table below specifies where the attributes are recognized.
Keep in mind that there are two ways to specify stream content metadata, data.Stream and data.Streams :
data.Stream : This is used when there is one stream URL,
typically an HLS or smooth streaming manifest URL.
data.Streams : This is used when you have a set of fixed bitrate
streams. This is typically the case for non-adaptive MP4 streams,
in which case multiple variants are specified to simulate true
adaptation.

Descriptive attributes
Descriptive metadata attributes can be used to describe the content
item to the user, in a user interface element that allows the user to
select the item.

Digital rights management (DRM) control attributes
Digital rights management (DRM) content meta-data control attributes are available in the Roku OS through the drmParams parameter of type roAssociativeArray . The table below enumerates all usable attributes of drmParams.
Note: Not all attributes are required, and may not have the same semantic meaning when applied to different DRM systems.
Attribute	DRM System	Type	Value	Example
appData	Playready, Widevine, Verimatrix: Optional	String	Special meaning per DRM system. If supplied, expected to be a base64 encoded string.	"SGF2ZSB0byBkZWFsIHdpdGggQmFzZTY0IGZ..."
encodingKey	Playready: Optional	String	This field is deprecated; use the licenseServerURL field.

Specifies the PlayReady license acquisition data, in format depending on the EncodingType attribute value specified:
when encodingType="PlayReadyLicenseAcquisitionUrl", the EncodingKey attribute contains the PlayReady license acquisition URL	" http://serverName/
encodingType	Playready: Optional	String	This field is deprecated; use the licenseServerURL field.

Specifies the encoding scheme for PlayReady DRM, by setting to one of the following values:
"PlayReadyLicenseAcquisitionUrl" "PlayReadyLicenseAcquisitionAndChallenge" Note, this is the same value that used to be specified directly in Content Metadata structure	"PlayReadyLicenseAcquisitionAndChallenge"
KeySystem	Required for all	String	"playready" or "widevine". This value is case-insensitive. The default is an empty string.

As of Roku OS 9.3, support for Verimatrix DRM has been removed from the firmware. Make sure that content in your app is protected using one of the following Roku-supported DRMs: Microsoft PlayReady or Widevine. Click here for more information on implementing these DRMs.	"widevine"
licenseRenewURL	Widevine: Optional	String	A URL location for sending license renewal requests. If not specified, the Roku OS would send renewal requests to the URL specified in the licenseServerURL.	" https://host.com/license/wideivne/renew?licenseid=090495867002 "
licenseServerURL	Playready: Required Widevine: Required	String	A URL location of a license server. This URL may include CGI parameters.

If this field contains the PlayReady license acquisition URL plus additional custom license acquisition request data in format "URL%%%", the “PlayReadyLicenseAcquisitionAndChallenge" type is used.	" https://host.com/license/playready?contentid=090495867002 "
serializationURL	Playready, Widevine: Optional	String	A server address used for device provisioning	" https://host.com/provision/device?esn=090495867002 "
serviceCert	Widevine: Optional Others: N/R (leave unset)	String	The actual certificate string for Widevine purposes, which must be obtained out-of-band (OOB) by the app. Leave this unset unless Widevine is used for DRM.	Certificate strings are too long to display here. Examples can be fetched from such sources as the Widevine test license server at " https://proxy.uat.widevine.com/proxy . "
lic_acq_window	Widevine: Optional	String	The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that an app waits before rotating its Widevine DRM keys. The app can generate a random wait time between 0 and the value specified in the lic_acq_window field, and use the random wait time to instruct when the Video node should make its next Widevine license request.	1000
ignoreInitDataPssh

Available since Roku OS 14.5	Widevine: Optional	String	Ignores the PSSH in the initialization segment. This enables support for Harmonic/DTV-GO DASH-IOP v5.0.0 streams with In-Band Key-Rotation Signaling without breaking legacy streams/apps that do not provide the <ContentProtection> element with PSSH info in the DASH manifest.

The default value is "false" .	"true"
licReqTemplate

Available since Roku OS 14.6	Widevine		Contains the license request "template, which is the entire license request without the license challenge filled-in

JSON or XML formats are supported.

Use this parameter and the templateType , requestField , and responseField parameters to wrap the Widevine license challenge payload in the request format (JSON or XML) required by your license server proxy.

See Example of wrapping the Widevine license challenge payload for more information.	"JSON"
templateType

Available since Roku OS 14.6	Widevine	String	Set to "JSON", "XML" or "BASE64"
- JSON: licReqTemplate is in json format
- XML: licReqTemplate is in XML format
- BASE64 - Does not use licReqTemplate Instead, base64 encode the challenge and send it in POST body
If no value is specified, the license template is not used	"JSON"
requestField

Available since Roku OS 14.6	Widevine	String	jsonpath or xpath to the element whose value must contain the fixed token LICENSE_CHALLENGE
- jsonpath if templateType is "JSON"
- xpath if templateType is "XML"

The Roku OS Roku replaces the LICENSE_CHALLENGE token with the base64 encoded license challenge.

As of Roku OS 15.0, the LICENSE_CHALLENGE token can be provided as a URL (in addition to a text string). The Roku OS automatically follows the challenge URLs properly.	".parameters[0].body"
responseField

Available since Roku OS 14.6	Widevine	String	json-path or xpath to the element that contains the base64 encoded license response
- jsonpath if templateType is "JSON"
- xpath if templateType is "XML"

The Roku OS extracts the license response, base64 decodes it, and provides it to the DRM client in the Roku firmware.

After setting the license response in the DRM agent , the license response is made available in the licenseStatus Playback field, which is an associative array. The response field in the associative array contains the entire license response.	".output.widevine2License.license"

when encodingType="PlayReadyLicenseAcquisitionAndChallenge", the EncodingKey attribute contains the PlayReady license acquisition URL plus additional custom license acquisition request data in format "URL%%%" Note, this is the same value that used to be specified directly in Content Metadata structure The app just needs to set drmParams.licenseSererUrl.

Passing custom HTTP headers to licensing requests
Developers looking to pass custom HTTP headers with a licensing request can now set those headers using the ifHttpAgent interface methods on the Video node.
Example of configuring a dash stream with Widevine DRM

    }
}

Example of wrapping the Widevine license challenge payload
The following code demonstrates how you can wrap the Widevine license challenge payload in the request format (JSON or XML) required by your license server proxy.
// set the content type
// for json it may be set to "application/json
// for xml it may be set to "text/xml" or "application/xml"
// if your license proxy cannot handle these content types,
// don't specify anything. The default content type
// used by Roku firmware is "text/plain", and most proxies
// seem to handle this content type
httpAgent = CreateObject("roHttpAgent")
httpAgent.AddHeader("Content-Type", "<contentType>")
m.video.drmHttpAgent = httpAgent
videocontent = createObject("RoSGNode", "ContentNode")
videocontent.drmParams = {
            keySystem: "Widevine"
            name: "Widevine"
            licenseServerURL: "https://proxy.uat.widevine.com/proxy?provider=widevine_test"
            licReqTemplate: "license request template"
            templateType: "JSON"
            requestField: ".parameters[0].body"
            responseField: ".output.widevine2License.license"
        }
...
m.video.content = videocontent

Content classification attributes
Available since Roku OS 13.0
Developers can use the contentClassifier content metadata attribute to specify the genre of their content (for example, action, sports, or comedy), and the Roku OS will use this attribute to automatically adjust the sound and picture on Roku TVs (if auto mode is selected for the picture or sound settings).
Content classifier value
Attribute	Type	Values	Example
contentClassifer	string	" " "action" "animated" "black+white" (black and white) "comedy" "drama" "music" "music:lyrics" "nature" "news" "podcast" (audio only) "reality" "sports"	"drama"

Stream	roAssociativeArray	Supported by roVideoPlayer and roVideoScreen, but not the Roku Scene Graph Video node.
For the Video node, use the top level url, streamformat, etc. attributes.

The exception is cases where you don't have adaptive streams (typically MP4) and need to specify different bitrate variants separately. For this use case use the Streams attribute. roAssociativeArray that has parameters representing the stream settings that were set as individual roArrays in previous firmware revisions.

The old method is still supported and descriptions of the parameters can be found under those content-meta data entries.

For url please see StreamUrls, for quality it is now a Boolean that is true for HD quality.
Key Type url String stickyredirects Boolean quality Boolean contentid String bitrate Integer	Key	Type	url	String	stickyredirects	Boolean	quality	Boolean	contentid	String	bitrate	Integer	{ url : " http://me.com/big.m3u8" , quality : true, contentid : "big-hls" }

contentid	String
bitrate	Integer
Streams	roArray of roAssociativeArrays	Used by roVideoPlayer and roVideoScreen to specify the content metadata for a set of fixed bitrate streams.

Each array item specifies the URL, bitrate, etc. for one stream variant.

Setting stream content metadata using the Streams value is recommended for non-adaptive video (such as MP4 progressive download) only.

For adaptive streaming, use the Stream metadata value.

Key	Type
url	String
stickyredirects	Boolean
quality	Boolean
contentid	String
bitrate	Integer
StreamBitrates	roArray	Array of bitrates in kbps for content streams used.

Setting stream bitrates using this value is recommended for non-adaptive video (such as MP4 progressive download) only.

Must be used in conjunction with StreamUrls and StreamQualities	[ 384, 500, 1000, 1500 ]
StreamUrls	roArray	Array of URLs for content streams.

Setting stream urls using this value is recommended for non-adaptive video (such as MP4 progressive download) only.

Must be used in conjunction with StreamBitrates and StreamQualities	[ "mysite.com/vid/1932-1.mp4", "mysite.com/vid/1932-2.mp4", "mysite.com/vid/1932-3.mp4", "mysite.com/vid/1932-4.mp4" ]

StreamStickyHttpRedirects	roArray	Array of Boolean values indicating if the HTTP endpoint should be sticky and not subject to change on subsequent requests. Default is false	[ false, false, false, false ]
StreamStartTimeOffset	Integer	Optional. Default is 0. The offset into the stream which is considered the beginning of playback. Time in seconds.	3600 (one hour)
StreamFormat	String	Type of content Type of content: Default: H.264/AAC in .mp4 Container Valid values: "mp4" (mp4 will also accept .mov and .m4v files) "wma" (deprecated) "mp3" "hls"
-"ism" (smooth streaming) "dash" (MPEG-DASH) "mkv", "mka", "mks" Deprecated: "wmv"
Length	Float	Movie Length in Seconds; Length zero displays at 0m, Length not set will not display	3600 (one hour)
PlayStart	Float	PlayStart defines the start position of the content, in seconds.

Starting from Roku OS 8.0, content metadata supports negative PlayStart values. This feature allows the media players to start playbacks distanced from the edge of the live stream	0
ClosedCaptions	Boolean	Boolean indicating if CC icon should be displayed	True
HDBranded	Boolean	Boolean indicating if HD branding should be displayed	True
IsHD	Boolean	Boolean indicating if content is HD	True
SubtitleColor	String	Theme metadata attribute that specifies the color to use when rendering subtitle text	"#FF0000"
SubtitleConfig	roAssociativeArray: {TrackName : String}	Specifies the caption settings for content playback.

TrackName sets the name of the caption track to render. This string is a concatenation of the track source and track id, separated by a "/".

Valid track sources are: "ism", "mkv", "eia608" and "dvb".

The track id must match the track identifier in the smooth or mkvmanifest. For example, if an mkvfile has a caption track called “english1” the TrackName to select this track is “mkv/english1”.

When the track source is "dvb", the track id is the three-letter language code, with "_sdh" appended for subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing. For example, "dvb/eng_sdh" are English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing and "dvb/nor" are normal Norwegian subtitles.

For sideloaded caption tracks, the TrackName is the url from where the caption track can be downloaded.Sideloaded caption formats can include srt,ttml, anddfxp. Specifying eia608/1 will trigger the Roku OS to search for embedded 608/708 captions in the stream. In the 8.0 Roku OS, automatic track selection based on a preferred caption language setting is introduced. Omit setting a URL here to avoid interfering with the automatic track selection. It is sufficient to add the URLs to SubtitleTracks	{ TrackName : "mkv/english1" }
SubtitleTracks	roArray of roAssociativeArray: [{Language : String, Description : String, TrackName : String},...]	SubtitleTracks sets the list of available caption tracks available to the stream. This list is added to the track list in the closed caption configuration dialog that is displayed during video playback when the user presses the Roku remote control * button. The captions from the selected track are then displayed on the screen. Language specifies the ISO 639.2B 3 character language code. This string is used to match the proper caption track with the audio language. Description specifies the text that will be shown for the corresponding track in the closed caption configuration dialog. For sideloaded caption tracks the TrackName is the URL from where the caption track can be downloaded. Sideloaded caption formats can include srt, ttml, and dfxp. The SubtitleTracks metadata is generally only used for side loaded captions. the Roku OS detects in-stream captions and thus specifying SubtitleTracks in this case is not necessary
SubtitleUrl	String	Specifies the path to an SRT or TTML formatted file used to render subtitles or closed captions, respectively. This is supported on roVideoScreen only. See Closed Caption Support for additional details	"mysite.com/vid/1932.srt"; "mysite.com/vid/1932.xml"
VideoDisableUI	Boolean	If set to true, hides the Scene Graph Video node trick play UI; If set to false (the default) shows the Scene Graph Video node trick play UI	video = createObject("roSGNode", "Video"); video.content.VideoDisableUI = true
EncodingType	String	Specifies the encoding scheme for PlayReady DRM, by setting to one of the following values: "PlayReadyLicenseAcquisitionUrl" "PlayReadyLicenseAcquisitionAndChallenge" Note, this is the same value that used to be specified directly in Content Metadata structure
EncodingKey	String	Specifies the PlayReady license acquisition URL, and additional custom request data, determined by the EncodingType attribute value specified: when encodingType="PlayReadyLicenseAcquisitionUrl", the EncodingKey attribute contains the PlayReady license acquisition URL
SwitchingStrategy	String	roVideoPlayer or roVideoScreen.

Specify different stream switching algorithms to be used in HLS adaptive streaming.
Only has an effect on HLS streams. "full-adaptation" uses measured bandwidth and buffer fullness to determine when to switch. This strategy requires that segments align across variants as the HLS spec requires. This is the new default	"full-adaptation"
Watched	Boolean	Flag indicating if content has been watched	True
ForwardQueryStringParams	Boolean	Controls whether query string parameters from initial HLS stream manifest requests are forward to subsequent segment download requests. The default value is set to true for backwards compatibility.	True
ForwardDashQueryStringParams	Boolean	Controls whether query string parameters from initial DASH stream manifest requests are forward to subsequent segment download requests. The default value is set to false for backwards compatibility.	False
IgnoreStreamErrors	Boolean	When set to true the media player will not stop playback when it runs into a streaming related error for this content. Instead, it will skip to the next item in the content list.

If this was the last item in the content list the media player will send a regular completion event (like isFullResult). Apps are still notified of any errors via an isRequestFailed notification but a new attribute in the event’s GetInfo object tells the app the error was ignored.

See the changes related to isRequestFailed for more information. The default value is false.	video_details = {
 streamFormat: "mp4"
 ignoreStreamErrors: true
 streams: [{bitrate: 537, height: 360, width: 640, url: “https://..."}]
}
AdaptiveMinStartBitrate	Integer	Minimum startup bitrate specified in kbps. Streaming will start with a variant equal to or greater than this value. If this value is not set or if it's set to zero, any minimum start bitrate will be ignored.	5000
AdaptiveMaxStartBitrate	Integer	Maximum startup bitrate specified in kbps. Streaming will start with a variant less than or equal to this value. If this value is not set, it will default to 2500 kbps.	2000
filterCodecProfiles	Boolean	Filters out any video profile/codec level combinations that the specified hardware cannot play. The default value is false, in which case no filtering occurs. Note that this currently only works for DASH streams.	True
LiveBoundsPauseBehavior	String	Allows an app to customize Media Player behavior on live streams when playing in the earliest part of a DVR buffer.

The stream remains paused even though it is playing in the earliest part of the buffer of a live stream when the value of the attribute is set to "pause." This enables the Roku OS to distinguish between live streams and live streams that eventually transition to video on demand.

The possible values of this attribute are "resume", "stop", "pause", with resume being the default value.

Currently, this attribute will work only with Smooth and Dash streams. (Available since Roku OS 8.1)	Resume
ClipStart	Float	ClipStart sets the clip start position of the playback. The unit of ClipStart is seconds (Available since Roku OS 8.1).	00.0
ClipEnd	Float	ClipEnd sets the clip end position. The unit of ClipEnd is seconds (Available since Roku OS 8.1).	00.0
PreferredAudioCodec	String	Specifies the audio codec that should be used during playback. The Media Player will select and report to the app only those audio renditions that are encoded with the specified codec. Renditions that are encoded with a different codec are ignored. Possible values of this attribute are "aac", "ac3" and "eac3".	"aac"
AudioWhitelist	String	Comma-separated list of audio tracks (based on ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 language code) that may be selected from the Audio track setting for the content.	"en, spa"
AudioBlacklist	String	Comma-separated list of audio tracks (based on ISO 639-1 or 639-2 language code) that may not be selected from the Audio track setting for the content.

(Available since Roku OS 9.4)

If a language is both blacklisted and whitelisted, the blacklisting takes precedence.	"ita, fr"
CaptionWhitelist	String	Comma-separated list of captioning tracks (based on ISO 639-2 language code) that may be selected from the Accessibility>Captioning track setting for the content.	"en, spa"
CaptionBlacklist	String	Comma-separated list of captioning tracks (based on ISO 639-2 language code) that may not be selected from the Accessibility>Captioning track setting for the content.

(Available since Roku OS 9.4)

If a language is both blacklisted and whitelisted, the blacklisting takes precedence.	"deu, dan"

CDN switching
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can be switched during playback to load balance traffic and failover to different servers in order to help optimize performance. The CdnConfig attribute can be used for managing load balancing and failovers.
Attribute	Type	Values	Description
cdnConfig	roArray of roAssociativeArrays	Key Required/ Optional Type Description URLFilter Required String A substring that identifies the (base)URL to which these CDN settings apply.

The Roku media player matches this string against all (base)URLs listed in the manifest and applies the setting to all (base)URLs that contain this substring. ContentFilter Optional String For DASH streams, a substring that filters the period or asset ID to which these CDN settings apply.

The Roku player only applies these CDN setting to periods with a period ID or asset ID that contains this substring.

This match is used in addition to the URL filter. Priority Required Integer For configuring failovers, sets the priority for this (base)URL from 1 to x (a priority of 0 or less is invalid).

A lower value indicates a higher priority. For example, a (base)URL with a priority of 1 is higher than another with a priority of 10.

If the highest priority server fails, traffic is routed to the server with the next highest priority. If all servers are configured with the same priority, and one fails, no failover will happen. Weight Required Integer For configuring load balancing, sets the relative weight for all (base)URLs with the same priority. This must be a value of 1 or greater (a weight of 0 disables a CDN).

The weight of a given BaseURL is its weight value divided by the sum of all weight values. This means that to spread the load equally across multiple CDNs with the same priority, set the weight for each to the same value. To configure the weights for two servers to 80% and a third server to 20%, for example, set servers one and two to 8 and server three to 4. ServiceLocation Optional String A blacklist of failed BaseURL locations.

ContentFilter	Optional	String	For DASH streams, a substring that filters the period or asset ID to which these CDN settings apply.

The Roku player only applies these CDN setting to periods with a period ID or asset ID that contains this substring.

This match is used in addition to the URL filter.
Priority	Required	Integer	For configuring failovers, sets the priority for this (base)URL from 1 to x (a priority of 0 or less is invalid).

A lower value indicates a higher priority. For example, a (base)URL with a priority of 1 is higher than another with a priority of 10.

If the highest priority server fails, traffic is routed to the server with the next highest priority. If all servers are configured with the same priority, and one fails, no failover will happen.
Weight	Required	Integer	For configuring load balancing, sets the relative weight for all (base)URLs with the same priority. This must be a value of 1 or greater (a weight of 0 disables a CDN).

The weight of a given BaseURL is its weight value divided by the sum of all weight values. This means that to spread the load equally across multiple CDNs with the same priority, set the weight for each to the same value. To configure the weights for two servers to 80% and a third server to 20%, for example, set servers one and two to 8 and server three to 4.
ServiceLocation	Optional	String	A blacklist of failed BaseURL locations.

Example
this.cur_clip.CDNConfig = [
    {URLFilter:"http://cdn1.xyz.com/abc/", ContentFilter, “testProgram”, priority: 1, weight: 50, serviceLocation: "west"},
    {URLFilter:"http://cdn2.xyz.com/abc/", ContentFilter, “testProgram”, priority: 1, weight: 50, serviceLocation: "east"},
    {URLFilter:"http://cdn1.xyz.com/abc/", ContentFilter, “testProgram”, priority: 2, weight: 50, serviceLocation: "west"},
    {URLFilter:"http://cdn2.xyz.com/abc/", ContentFilter, “testProgram”, priority: 2, weight: 50, serviceLocation: "east"},

SceneGraph certificate attributes
The SceneGraph certificate meta-data attributes are used to configure
the use of HTTP certificates and cookies by the Audio and Video nodes.
Please note that when setting any of the following four attributes on
a Video or Audio node, you need to be careful that the values are set on
the correct HTTPAgent. If the node does not have its own HTTPAgent, set
by explicitly calling setHttpAgent() on the node, the Roku OS will
traverse up the scene graph hierarchy until it finds the first node in
the Video or Audio node's ancestry that has set an HTTPAgent. If none
is found, the values will be set on the global HTTPAgent which is always
guaranteed to exist. Therefore if you expect the header, etc. values
set to only apply to your Audio and Video nodes, create a unique
instance of roHttpAgent for them and assign it directly. For example,
for a Video node you should do the following:
'Assume video is a valid Video node instance

httpAgent = CreateObject("roHttpAgent")
video.setHttpAgent(httpAgent)

Attribute	Type	Values
HttpCertificatesFile	uri	If set, the Scene Graph Audio or Video node loads this public certificate bundle, to authenticate the server. The protocol must be https for this to have any effect. When used with a Scene Graph Audio or Video node, the node or global HttpAgent is found, as explained elsewhere in this documentation. When playing this content, the agent is updated in the following manner: If this attribute is defined, the file URI is set into the HttpAgent instance. However, if this attribute is specified and the value is the empty string (""), then no changes will be made to the HttpAgent. If this attribute is not defined, the behavior depends upon whether the Content Meta-Data (CMD) contains secure (https) URLs: If no secure URLs exist in the meta-data, then no certificates file path is set into the agent. If a secure URL does exist, the platform's default certificates are set into the agent.
HttpCookies	array of strings	If set, the Scene Graph Audio or Video node send the cookies to the server. Each cookie must have the following syntax: dom=domain;path=path;name=name;val=value; When used with a Scene Graph Audio or Video node, the node or global HttpAgent is found, as explained elsewhere in this documentation. When this Content Meta-Data is played and this attribute is set, all HTTP cookies in the agent are cleared and replaced with the cookies defined by this attribute
HttpHeaders	array of strings	If set, the Scene Graph Audio or Video node sends these headers to the server. Each string must be of the format "name:value". When used with a Scene Graph Audio or Video node, the node or global HttpAgent is found, as explained elsewhere in this documentation. When this Content Meta-Data is played and this attribute is set, all HTTP headers in the agent are cleared and replaced with the headers defined by this attribute
HttpSendClientCertificate	Boolean	If true, the Scene Graph Audio or Video node sends the client device certificate to the server, for client authentication. The protocol must be https for this to have any effect. When used with a Scene Graph Audio or Video node, the node or global HttpAgent is found, as explained elsewhere in this documentation. When this Content Meta-Data is played and this attribute exists, the value of this attribute (true or false) is set into the HttpAgent

drmHttpAgent for handling DRM key/license requests separately
Since Roku OS 9.3, you can create a separate agent to handle DRM key and license requests, apart from other types
of requests.
Once you have created your agent, you can set the Video node's drmHttpAgent field directly to designate that the special
agent is to supersede any currently-set agent in the case of DRM key and license requests. The drmHttpAgent field must be configured before setting the content in the Video node.
' Configure the DRM HttpAgent before setting content in the Video node
 httpAgent = CreateObject("roHttpAgent")
 httpAgent.AddHeader("DRM-Specific-1", "weqweqweqweqweqweqeqeqeqeqwe")
 httpAgent.AddHeader("DRM-Specific-2", "fgfgfgfgfgfgfgfgfg")
 httpAgent.AddHeader("DRM-Specific-3", "zxzxzxzxxzxzxzxzxzx")
 m.video.drmHttpAgent = httpAgent
 m.video.content = videocontent

If drmHttpAgent is not set (the default), uri fetches for video involving the DRM URLs
( serializationURL , licenseServerURL , licenseRenewURL ) of ContentMetaData will
use the video's regular HttpAgent. However, if the drmHttpAgent is set, the agent
cited in the field will be used for those fetches instead.
The "SceneGraph Certificate Attributes" mentioned above all have "Drm" versions,
with names formed by the prefixing "Drm" to the "regular" names
(e.g., HttpCookies becomes DrmHttpCookies , and so forth).
These attributes take precedence over those of the drmHttpAgent.
Playback control attributes
The playback control meta-data attributes are used to control
the playback parameters for the content item.
Attribute	Type	Values	Example
MinBandwidth	Integer	roVideoPlayer or roVideoScreen: Will only select variant streams with a bandwidth higher than this minimum bandwidth. Units are kbps. By default Wowza servers set streams to 64 kbs, so you might want to set this parameter to something smaller than 64 when first testing Wowza streams. You will eventually want to specify the Wowza bitrates with a smil file (Please see the encoding guide)	48
MaxBandwidth	Integer	roVideoPlayer or roVideoScreen: Will only select variant streams with a bandwidth less than this maximum bandwidth. Units are kbps	2500
AudioPIDPref	Integer	This attribute is deprecated

Users can select their preferred audio language on-device in the Settings > Audio > Audio Preferred Language screen.	483
FullHD	Boolean	roVideoPlayer or roVideoScreen: Specify that this stream was encoded at 1080p resolution	true
