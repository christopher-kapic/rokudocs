Manifest file
Root level
The root level of all Roku apps must contain a manifest file
( pkg:/manifest ) containing important attributes for the application.
These attributes include but are not limited to the following:
Name and version number of the application
App icon
Splash screen image

Manifest guidelines
Each attribute is on a separate line, and has the form name=value
Each name=value pair must end with a newline character, or it may
not be parsed by the Roku OS
The last line must end with a newline character
Empty lines are ignored
Lines beginning with a '#' (number sign) are comment lines and are
ignored
All graphics files specified in the manifest file should be included
in the images directory
The URI to set the path to the files should use the pkg: resource
prefix, such as pkg:/images/splash-screen.png

Required attributes
These are the minimum attributes required for every Roku app:
Attribute	Type	Description	Sample manifest entry	Specification
title	string	name of the app	title=Roku Media Player
major_version	integer	major portion of the app version	major_version=1

splash_screen_sd	string	local URI for the SD splash screen displayed when the app is launched	splash_screen_hd=pkg:/images/splash-screen_SD.jpg	720x480

Optional attributes
The following categories of attributes are optional:
Voice control attributes
Attribute	Type	Description	Sample manifest entry
supports_etc_seek	integer	Enables handling of "seek" and "start over" voice commands.

If this flag is not enabled, an error message is displayed when an app receives a "seek" or "start over" command.	supports_etc_seek=1
supports_etc_next	integer	Enables handling of "next" voice commands.

If this flag is not enabled, an error message is displayed when an app receives a "next" command.	supports_etc_next=1
supports_voice_roinput	integer	Specifies that the app supports voice controls.	supports_voice_roinput=1
voice_action_launch_screen	integer	Specifies that the app displays a hands-free voice profile selection screen upon launch.	voice_action_launch_screen=1

Splash screen attributes
Attribute	Type	Description	Sample manifest entry	Specification
splash_color	hex value	background color to use if the splash screen image is not full screen	splash_color=#121212
splash_min_time	integer	minimum amount of time (in milliseconds) to display the splash screen

If no value is specified, then 1600 (1.6 seconds) is used. If 0 is specified, then there is no default time, so the splash screen disappears as soon as the application displays its first screen. (This may result in the appearance of flashing, if your application shows its first screen quickly).	splash_min_time=1500
splash_screen_fhd	string	local URI for the FHD splash screen

The FHD splash screen image is scaled down for HD display mode but this attribute can be used to specify a resolution-specific splash screen image.	splash_screen_fhd=pkg:/images/splash-screen_FHD.png	1920x1080
splash_rsg_optimization	integer	Roku recommends that you do not use this attribute at this time as it may deplete your app's available memory resources. Set this attribute to remove the black screen flash in SceneGraph apps. This is only applicable for SceneGraph apps and only if the first screen is a SceneGraph component.	splash_rsg_optimization=1

Graphics scaling attributes
Attribute	Type	Description	Sample manifest entry
ui_resolutions	comma separated values	A comma-separated list of up to three strings that identify the UI resolutions the application has been designed to support.	ui_resolutions=sd,hd,fhd
uri_resolution_autosub	comma separated values	Provides a flexible way to specify graphical image URIs that are automatically modified to replace a specified string with a string that gets a resolution-specific graphical image.

The attribute value is a comma-separated list of four strings that specify the string to be replaced along with the replacement strings for SD, HD and FHD resolutions. For example, suppose the manifest includes this line: uri_resolution_autosub=$$RES$$,SD,720p,1080p And the Roku player supports full high-definition resolution. Then if the application specifies a URI of: http://www.roku.com/testChannel/assets/$$RES$$/rokuTV.jpg . At runtime that URI will be modified to: http://www.roku.com/testChannel/assets/1080p/rokuTV.jpg and the application will get the full-high definition version of the graphical image in the specified directory.	uri_resolution_autosub=$$RES$$,SD,720p,1080p

The default setting for ui_resolutions is ui_resolutions=sd,hd sd Applications designed for standard definition 720x480 hd Applications designed for high definition 1280x720 fhd Applications designed for full high definition 1920x1080

Launch requirement attributes
Attribute	Type	Description	Sample manifest entry
supports_input_launch	integer	The roInputEvent is used to check whether a deep link has been passed into the application while your app is running. This enables your application to deep link into content without re-launching your app. This attribute must be added to the manifest for this functionality to work.	supports_input_launch=1
requires_gaming_remote	integer	Specifies that a gaming remote must be linked to the Roku Player to launch the application. If not, a dialog box is presented to the user.	requires_gaming_remote=1
requires_mkv	integer	Playing MKV files requires the use of a dynamically loaded library that is not part of the initially booted image. Therefore, an entry must be added to the manifest of any applications that require MKV support so that support is enabled when the app is launched.	requires_mkv=1
network_not_required	integer	Set to 1 to specify the application does not require the network (such as the USB Media Player). This lets the user launch an application even if there is no network connection.	network_not_required=1
bs_libs_required	string	Specifies the BrightScript libraries required for the application.	bs_libs_required=roku_ads_lib
usb_media_handler	integer	Set to 1 to specify if the app can be auto-launched when a USB device is inserted.	usb_media_handler=1

DRM attributes
Attribute	Type	Description	Sample manifest entry
requires_verimatrix_drm	integer	Downloads the required library to use Verimatrix DRM.	requires_verimatrix_drm=1
requires_verimatrix_version	value	Specifies the version of Verimatrix DRM to use. Roku currently supports version 1.0.	requires_verimatrix_version=1.0<br />

As of Roku OS 9.3, support for Verimatrix DRM has been removed from the firmware. Make sure that content in your app is protected using one of the following Roku-supported DRMs: Microsoft PlayReady or Widevine. Click here for more information on implementing these DRMs.

See Content Protection for implementation details.
Special purpose attributes
Attribute	Type	Description	Sample manifest entry
hidden	integer	The hidden property tells the Roku OS to not display the app on the home screen. Hidden apps can still be launched over the network via the External Control API .	hidden=1
playonly_aware	integer	Attribute to specify the application responds to the PlayOnly remote control button event. If not set, the application will receive the Play event instead when the user selects the button.	playonly_aware=1
pause_aware	integer	Attribute to specify the application responds to the pause remote control button event.

When this attribute is not set (the default), the application will not respond to the pause event and will toggle between "play" and "pause" modes when it receives the play event.

When the attribute is set to 1 , the play event strictly indicates play-mode (no toggling), and a pause event is necessary to invoke pause-mode.	pause_aware=1
channel_token		Token string used to grant access for specific Roku platform features (for example, Continue Watching)	ewogICJpc3MiOiAidXJuOnJva3UuY29tOnRva2VubWludDpjaGFubmVsdG9rZW4iLAogICJhdWQiOiAidXJuOnJva3UuY29tOnN0Yi9jaGFubmVsIiwKICAic3ViIjogInVybjpyb2t1LmNvbTpzdGIvNzAzMDM0IiwKICAianRpIjogInVybjo4ZjNhN2FiNi1mMWJkLTQ1MTYtOTRiNS0wYTc3ZjNmMDY2OGEiLAogICJpYXQiOiAxNzA1NTI3NzE4LAogICJleHAiOiAyMDIwODg3NzE4LAogICJuYmYiOiAxNDU2NzkwNDAwLAogICJyb2t1LXRmdiI6ICIxIiwKICAicm9rdS1wZXJtIjogWwogICAgImp3dF9oZWFkZXIiCiAgXSwKICAicm9rdS1jaGFubmVsLWlkIjogWwogICAgIjEiCiAgXQp9
run_as_process	Integer	Required for integrating Instant Resume and using the chanperf debug command , Roku Resource Monitor , and Perfetto .	run_as_process=1
rsg_version	value	Sets the SceneGraph observer callback model .

If using Roku OS 9.0 or above, use rsg_version=1.2 . This enables a new internal mechanism for processing component <script> tags that optimizes the resulting compiled script code resulting in a reduced initial startup time and lesser memory usage while preserving compatibility.

If using a Roku component library node , the rsg_version flag needs to be declared in the component library's manifest as well.

Eval() is deprecated. Eval() cannot be used with rsg_version=1.2 .

The manifest entry defaults to 1.2 as of Roku OS 9.3 if it's not specified in the manifest.

Note that support for the “rsg_version=1.0” manifest flag is deprecated as of Roku OS 8.	rsg_version=1.2
automatic_audio_guide_disabled	integer	Set to 1 to disable screen reader within an app.	automatic_audio_guide_disabled=1
disable_audio_guide_shortcut	integer	Disables the shortcut for activating the screen reader (pressing the options key [*] four times ).	disable_audio_guide_shortcut=1`
bs_prof_enabled	boolean	Enable BrightScript profiling	bs_prof_enabled=true
confirm_partner_button	integer	This new feature has been added that launches a confirmation dialogue before launching an app when the user presses one of the four app-specific buttons on the Roku remote. This minimizes the number of unintended app launches after accidentally hitting a button while fast forwarding or rewinding content in a different app. When this manifest flag is set to “1” (confirm_partner_button=1), the OS will display a confirmation HUD (Head Up Display) any time the user presses a partner app button while in that app. By default, the OS will always display this confirmation HUD when a partner button is pressed during video playback, regardless of if the manifest flag has been set.	confirm_partner_button=1
suppress_unconnected_hud	integer	Manifest entry for overriding network connectivity HUD. This attribute is used to override the system level display that indicates when media playback is interrupted due to network connection failures. For more information on the connectivity HUD, please read the related support article	suppress_unconnected_hud=[1|0]

(1 suppresses, 0 enables).
dial_title	string	The name of the title used by the Roku DIAL server to identify the app.	dial_title=2Dvideo
game	integer	All game apps must add the game manifest entry to their manifest file. This flag prevents the app from having audio/sound effects delays in the game.	game=1

requires_audiometadata	integer	The roAudioMetadata component requires the use of a dynamically loaded library that is not part of the initially booted image. Therefore, an entry must be added to the manifest of any applications that use the roAudioMetadata component so that it can be loaded when the app is launched.	requires_audiometadata=1
requires_bluetooth	integer	Specifies that a Bluetooth remote must be linked to the box to launch the app. If not, a dialog box is presented to the user. This attribute has been superseded by requires_gaming_remote .	requires_bluetooth=1
