External Control Protocol (ECP)
The External Control Protocol (ECP) enables a Roku device to be controlled over a local area network by providing a number of external control services. The Roku devices offering these external control services are discoverable using SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol). ECP is a simple RESTful API that can be accessed by programs in virtually any programming environment.
As of Roku OS 14.1, the Settings > System > Advanced system settings > Control by mobile apps feature must be set to "Enabled" for a Roku device to receive the following ECP commands:
keypress
keydown
keyup
query/icon
query/tv-channels
query/tv-active-channel

In addition, the following ECP commands require the Roku device to be in developer mode and the Control by mobile apps setting to be "Enabled":
query/chanperf
query/r2d2-bitmaps
query/sgnodes
query/sgrendezvous and sgrendezvous
query/registry
query/graphics-frame-rate
query/fwbeacons and fwbeacons
query/app-object-counts
query/app-state
exit-app

As of Roku OS 12.0, the "search" command is no longer available.
Support for sending ECP commands from within a Roku app has been discontinued. Apps may no longer include code in their app that is designed to issue any type of ECP command. Static Analysis testing has been updated to check apps for ECP commands. Apps that include ECP commands in their code will automatically be blocked from publishing to the Streaming Store.
In addition, ECP commands may not be sent from 3rd-party platforms (for example, mobile applications).
Apps may still include code for handling incoming ECP commands sent by the Roku OS for deep links , voice controls , and so on.
To further leverage ECP commands for testing an app's performance and behavior, it is recommended that developers integrate Roku's automation test software in their test suite.
Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)
SSDP is an industry IETF standard network protocol for discovery of
local area network services. Roku devices advertise their external
control services using the multicast SSDP so that programs can discover
the IP address of Roku devices in the area. There is a standard SSDP
multicast address and port (239.255.255.250:1900) used for local area
network communication. The Roku device responds to M-SEARCH queries on
this IP address and port.
To query for a Roku device IP address, send the following HTTP request
to 239.255.255.250 port 1900:
M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1
Host: 239.255.255.250:1900
Man: "ssdp:discover"
ST: roku:ecp

There must be a blank line at the end of the file above. If you
put the above request into a file such as roku_ecp_req.txt, you can
issue the following command on most Linux machines to test the request:
$ ncat -u 239.255.255.250 1900 < roku_ecp_req.txt

If you view the response using Wireshark, and filter on port 1900, you
can see the Roku device response (Ncat has trouble receiving multicast
traffic, so viewing the response using Ncat does not work). The response
has the following format:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
ST: roku:ecp
Location: http://192.168.1.134:8060/
USN: uuid:roku:ecp:P0A070000007

If you get a 200 status response, the Location header is valid. You can
parse out the URL for the Roku device external control services from the
Location header. The Roku device serial number is contained in the USN
line after uuid:roku:ecp. Note that if there are multiple Roku devices
in your local area network, you will get multiple responses. Your
program could keep a map of USNs to location URLs, and allow the user to
select which Roku device on the network to control. We recommend you let
the user assign names to the USNs.
When parsing headers in the response, in accordance with the UPnP Device
Architecture specification, field names should not be treated as case
sensitive. That means that, for example, the Location header may begin
with either "Location:" or "LOCATION:" or "location:", and so forth.
Please note the Cache-Control header. Roku devices multicast NOTIFY
messages periodically (approximately every 20 minutes). It is safe to
assume the unit is no longer available if you have not received a new
NOTIFY message before the Cache-Control max-age time expires.
External control service commands
The external control services provided by ECP are included in a simple
RESTful API accessed using HTTP on port 8060. Once you have the Roku
device IP address, you can issue the following external control service
commands to the Roku device.
General ECP commands
Command	Description	Required Device Settings
query/media-player	Returns a child element named 'player' that identifies the media player state. The information returned includes the current stream segment and position of the content being played, the running time of the content, audio format, and buffering. This command is accessed using an HTTP GET.
keydown/<KEY>	Equivalent to pressing the remote control key identified after the slash. This command is sent using an HTTP POST with no body.	Control by mobile apps setting “Enabled”
keyup/<KEY>	Equivalent to releasing the remote control key identified after the slash. This command is sent using an HTTP POST with no body.	Control by mobile apps setting “Enabled”
keypress/<KEY>	Equivalent to pressing down and releasing the remote control key identified after the slash. You can also use this command, and the keydown and keyup commands, to send keyboard alphanumeric characters when a keyboard screen is active, as described in Keypress Key Values . This command is sent using an HTTP POST with no body.	Control by mobile apps setting “Enabled”
query/device-info	Retrieves device information similar to that returned by roDeviceInfo. This command is accessed using an HTTP GET.

As of Roku OS 15.0, this command returns the following fields that indicate whether TV power and audio volume control have been enabled on a Roku streaming player:

- supports-tv-power-control
- supports-audio-volume-control
query/icon/<APP_ID>	supports-tv-power-control supports-audio-volume-controlReturns an icon corresponding to the application identified by appID. The binary data with an identifying MIME-type header is returned. This command is accessed using an HTTP GET. Example: GET /query/icon/1	Control by mobile apps setting “Enabled”
query/chanperf

query/chanperf/< channelld >?duration-seconds=< seconds >	Returns the current memory and CPU utilization of the app running in the foreground (RAM usage is reported bytes). The foreground app may either be a sideloaded app or an app from the Streaming Store. To output the results for an app in the app store, the device must be keyed with the same developer ID/key that was used to generate the package file.

Including the channelId option in the path outputs statistics for a specific app from the Streaming Store. To use this command, the device must be keyed with the same developer ID/key that was used to generate the package file. The app's process ID (pid) is added to the output of this command.	Developer mode enabled

Control by mobile apps setting “Enabled”
query/r2d2-bitmaps	Returns a list of the assets that have been loaded into texture memory and the amount of used, available, and maximum memory on your device (in bytes).

query/sgnodes/all?count_only=true&sizes=true	Returns all the nodes created by the currently running app. This includes the number of osref references to the node (held in the Roku platform) and bscref references (held in the app).

The bcsref count includes references from "m." variable and local variables. Child references and field references do not increase bscref counts. The bscref count provides a more relevant and accurate indication of the resources that the app itself controls. - The count_only parameter returns the total number of objects as a parameter in the All-Nodes field .
- The size parameter returns the memory used by the object (in kB).	Developer mode enabled

Control by mobile apps setting “Enabled”
query/sgnodes/roots?count_only=true&sizes=true	Prints every existing node without a parent that has been created by the currently running app. The existence of these un-parented nodes means they are being kept alive by direct BrightScript references.

If the app supports Instant Resume and is running in the background or the app does not support Instant Resume and is running, sending this command terminates the app.	Developer mode enabled

Control by mobile apps setting “Enabled”
input	Sends custom events to the current application. It takes a user defined list of name-value pairs sent as query string URI parameters. The external control server places these name-value pairs into an associative array, and passes them directly through to the currently executing app script using a Message Port attached to a created roInput object.

Input Command Conventions includes detailed recommendations on how to pass your data.

Messages of type roInputEvent have a GetInfo() method that will obtain the associative array. The arguments must be URL-encoded.

This command is sent using an HTTP POST with no body. Example: POST /input?acceleration.x=0.0&acceleration.y=0.0&acceleration.z=9.8

Including duration-seconds in the query string executes and repeats the chanperf command the specified number of seconds. To cancel a repeating command, use the chanperf command with no arguments or with the duration-seconds parameter set to 0 ("chanperf" or "chanperf/duration-seconds=0"). The default duration is 1 second.

The osref count also includes child references and references from Roku SceneGraph interface fields. For example, for any node with a parent, the parent will count as one osref on the child. Additionally, any field of type node , nodearray , or assocarray will add one osref to each node referenced from within that field. These could be in variables local to a function, arrays, or associative arrays, including a component global m or an associative array field of a node. The reported osref count may vary from release to release of Roku OS; the information here is provided only to give a sense of the kinds of items that the count includes.

Roku TV ECP commands
Roku TV devices additionally support the following external control
services.
Command	Description
query/tv-channels	Returns information about the TV channel / line-up available for viewing in the TV tuner UI.
query/tv-active-channel	Returns information about the currently tuned TV channel.

Input command conventions
As the Roku OS simply marshals the arguments to the input command
and passes them to the app script, the forms below compose a
conventional way to communicate input from several common input device
types.
Sensor input values
There are four sensor input values to report: accelerometer,
orientation, gyroscope (rotation), and magnetometer (magnetic). All
except orientation are vectors in a cartesian coordinate system relative
to the device in its default orientation:
+x = to the right of the front face of the device (usually the
short side)
+y = to the top of the front face of the device (usually the long
side)
+z = out of the front face of the device (toward the viewer)

The orientation coordinate system is relative to the point on the
surface of the Earth between the device and the center of the Earth:
+x = east
+y = north
+z = towards the center of the Earth (down)

The type in all such cases is a string representation of a signed
floating point number, with or without an explicit decimal, and with or
without a signed integer exponent following the letter E. A missing
decimal will be presumed after the rightmost present digit, and a
missing exponent will be presumed 0.
Accelerometer
indicates: acceleration in each dimension relative to free fall
units: meters/sec^2
names: acceleration.x, acceleration.y, acceleration.z
Orientation
indicates: angular displacement from flat/level and true (or magnetic?)
north.
units: radians
names: orientation.x, orientation.y, orientation.z
notes: Accurate indication of this is not generally possible without
correlation with other sensors or assumptions. Devices make assumptions
to flip the display, for example, that assume that the device is usually
not moving (much) so that all force is simply opposed to gravity, and
that can be assumed to be the "up" direction. Deviation from magnetic
north depends on a magnetometer, and deviation from true north also
depends on geolocation.
Gyroscope
indicates: angular rotation rate about each axis using the right hand
rule for sign
units: radians/sec
names: rotation.x, rotation.y, rotation.z
Magnetometer
indicates: magnetic field strength
units: micro-Tesla
names: magnetic.x, magnetic.y, magnetic.z
Touch and multi-touch
Touch and multi-touch commands take the same form. The resource is the
same "input" as all other generic input commands.
Each action is decomposed to an argument in each dimension (of 2, x and
y with the same orientation as for the sensor inputs, with origin in
lower left). There is an additional "op" argument which can specify
down, up, press (down and up), move, or cancel. Each input is also
qualified with a pointer id that indicates the initial order of down
touches in a multi-touch gesture.
Several such points can be specified in a single POST, especially a
move, but a full triad of x, y, and op arguments should be sent, and
expected for each point, within a POST that contains any of them.
Additional input values
Other information you might want to pass using the input command may
include:
sensor accuracy
geolocation (from GPS)
device-provided derivations of above sensor readings, for example
"shake" from accelerometer, or "pinch" from multi-touch

External Control Protocol examples
The following are some example ECP commands sent via the curl command.

Deep linking to an app
One of the most common ways that app developers encounter ECP is
deep linking. Deep linking lets other parts of the system launch a
particular piece of content via parameters passed to the app at
launch time. See this section on Deep Linking for implementation details.
The standard for deep linking uses parameters:
Parameter	Description	Possible Values
contentID	Partner defined unique identifier for a specific piece of content	Any value < 255 characters long and not using "&" or other characters that are not URL encoded
mediaType	Parameter to give context to the type of contentID passed	"series", "season", "episode", movie", "shortFormVideo", and "tvSpecial"

You trigger deep linking by doing an HTTP post to port 8060 on your Roku
device. The general form is
http://<IP of Roku>:8060/launch/[dev | channeID]?contentId=<content ID>&MediaType=<mediaType>

The first example will launch the current sideloaded application and
deep link to a season contentID 1234. Notice the -d ' ' which forces
it to do a http post.
curl -d '' "http://$ROKU_DEV_TARGET:8060/launch/dev?contentID=13234&MediaType=season"

You can also just launch the app without deep linking by
removing the arguments from the URL: http://$ROKU_DEV_TARGET:8060/launch/8378
You can find the app ID of a production app by using one of
the two deep link test tools https://devtools.web.roku.com/DeepLinkingTester/ https://my.roku.com/account/add?channel=KX3UPK

Keypress key values
When the current screen on the Roku box includes an on-screen keyboard,
any keyboard character can be sent via the keyup, keydown, and keypress
commands. The key parameter can either be a key name, such as the name
of a button on a remote control, or a printable character value
specified with the prefix "Lit_".
Printable ASCII character code values can be transmitted "as-is" with
the "Lit_" prefix. For example, you can send a 'r' with "Lit_r". In
addition, any UTF-8 encoded character can be sent by URL-encoding it.
For example, the euro symbol can be sent with "Lit_%E2%82%AC".
There are even some keys you can send that are not available on any
physical remote. Enter is for completing keyboard entry fields, such
as search fields (it is not the same as Select). Search is used for pressing and holding down the microphone/magnifying glass button, which causes the Roku Voice heads-up display to listen for a voice command.
The following are the key names that are recognized by ECP:
  Home
  Rev
  Fwd
  Play
  Select
  Left
  Right
  Down
  Up
  Back
  InstantReplay
  Info
  Backspace
  Search
  Enter

Roku devices that support the "Find Remote" support:
  FindRemote

*Note that query/device-info includes a supports-find-remote flag that indicates whether the Roku device supports FindRemote.
However, this does not specifically indicate that the device has a paired remote that supports "Find remote" as well.
Some Roku devices, such as Roku TVs, also support:
  VolumeDown
  VolumeMute
  VolumeUp
  PowerOff

Roku TV devices also support changing the app when watching the TV tuner input:
  ChannelUp
  ChannelDown

Roku TV devices also support keys to set the current TV input UI:
  InputTuner
  InputHDMI1
  InputHDMI2
  InputHDMI3
  InputHDMI4
  InputAV1

Example: On the on-screen keyboard, the string 'roku' can be sent via the following commands:
$ curl -d '' "http://$ROKU_DEV_TARGET:8060/keypress/Lit_r"
$ curl -d '' "http://$ROKU_DEV_TARGET:8060/keypress/Lit_o"
$ curl -d '' "http://$ROKU_DEV_TARGET:8060/keypress/Lit_k"
$ curl -d '' "http://$ROKU_DEV_TARGET:8060/keypress/Lit_u"

Example programs
There is a sample External Control Protocol application available that
requires only glibc to compile. The program is self contained in the
/examples/rokuExternalControl.c file in the sample. You can compile and run
it with the following commands:
$ cd SDK_directory
$ gcc ./examples/rokuExternalControl.c –o rokuExternalControl
$ ./rokuExternalControl

On Windows, it can be compiled with the following line:
> cl /D "WIN32" rokuExternalControl.c

The program first uses SSDP to query for Roku devices in the local area
network. The first Roku device that responds is the one to which
commands are sent. All requests and responses are printed to stdout so
that you can easily follow what the program is doing. The program next
moves the cursor to the home screen and highlights the "Netflix"
program. It does this by sending the Home key command, and then holding
down the left key for twelve seconds. Then it sends the Right key three
times. After keeping the "Netflix" program highlighted for five seconds,
the program launches the "simplevideoplayer" application with url and
streamformat as keys in the associative array passed to the Main() entry
point. The simplevideoplayer application immediately launches the
roVideoScreen when launched with an associative array containing valid
url and streamformat keys.
With ECP, you have complete control of your Roku device over the
network. We can't wait to see what kind of solutions our developer
community can create. The sample C program can be quickly modified to
run in a variety of environments including Firefox, IE, and other
browser plugins, iPhone, iPad, and other mobile device environments.
The SDK also includes a couple of Java applications. There is an Android
remote application in examples/source/ecp_client/android_remote, and a
simple application to find Roku devices on the local area network in
examples/source/ecp_client/Roku_Finder.
DIAL (Discovery and Launch)
The Roku platform supports the DIAL (Discovery and Launch) protocol.
DIAL is a simple network protocol for discovering first screen devices,
and applications from a second screen (such as a mobile iOS or Android
application,) and for launching first screen applications on the first
screen device from the second screen app. In the context of the Roku
platform, the first screen device is the Roku device itself. A first
screen application is a DIAL-aware app installed on the Roku device.
Complete details of the DIAL specification can be found here:
http://www.dial-multiscreen.org/dial-protocol-specification .
Many current Roku developers are familiar with the Roku external control
protocol (ECP) which includes functionality similar to DIAL. An
experienced Roku developer may thus fairly ask the question "why do I
need DIAL?" One reason is that you may already have a DIAL based second
screen implementation for use with other platforms. DIAL support on the
Roku platform means that you don’t need to add a second protocol to your
current application for discovery and launch.
The Roku DIAL sample contains
detailed documentation of Roku DIAL support, as well as BrightScript,
Android, and iOS sample applications. In DIAL parlance, the
BrightScript sample is the first screen application, and the Android and
iOS apps are the second screen applications. These sample applications
should help you get started with your own Roku DIAL support.
