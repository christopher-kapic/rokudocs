Roku WebDriver
The Roku WebDriver is required to control an app. It can be used in conjunction with the Roku Robot Framework Library , Roku JavaScript library , another test framework, or a programming language or a programming language such as Python, Java, or Go to execute test cases.
Roku WebDriver APIs
Roku's WebDriver includes a set of Selenium-based REST APIs for sending commands to a Roku device. These APIs conform to the WebDriver standards specified by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Specifically, the Roku WebDriver provides an HTTP-compliant JSON wire protocol with endpoints that map to their respective commands.
Path segments that are prefixed with a colon (:) represent variables. For example, the :sessionId variable is included in most command paths. This variable represents the ID of the session to be retrieved or the session where a command is to be sent.
The following table lists the available commands:
HTTP Method	Path	Summary
GET	/status	Queries the server's current status.
POST	v1/session	Creates a new session.
GET	v1/sessions	Returns a list of the currently active sessions.

Command requests
All command requests and POST/PUT message bodies are sent with a content-type of application/json;charset=UTF-8 .
Command responses
Command responses are sent as HTTP/1.1 response messages . The following sections describe how the successful, invalid, and failed commands responses are sent.
Success
For successful requests, a 2xx HTTP response is returned. Successful command responses and the included message body are sent with a Content-Type of application/json;charset=UTF-8 . The JSON message body includes the following properties:
Key	Type	Description
sessionId	string	The advertising ID of the device.
status	number	A status code summarizing the result of the command:

Invalid
For invalid requests (unknown command or resource not found), a 4xx HTTP response is returned. Invalid command responses are sent with a content-type of text-plain , and include a message body with a descriptive error message.
Failed
If a request maps to a valid command and contains all of the expected parameters in the request body, but fails to execute successfully, a 500 Internal Server Error is returned. The response and included message body have a Content-Type of application/json;charset=UTF-8 . The message body includes two JSON objects—one with the applicable command response status, and the other with a description of the failure:
