Roku Robot Framework Library
Roku's Robot Framework Library enables keyword-driven testing of apps. The library resides in a Python class that has methods that map directly to keyword names. The keywords take the same arguments as the methods implementing them. The keywords report failures with exceptions, create logs by writing to standard output, and return values using the return statement.
Instantiating the library
To create an instance of the Roku Framework Robot Library, provide the following four arguments:
Argument	Description
ip	The IP address of the device to be used for testing.
path	The path to the Roku WebDriver.
timeout	The amount of time (in milliseconds) that commands are allowed to run.
pressDelay	The amount of time (in milliseconds) between keypress commands. This argument works with the Send keys command.

The following example demonstrates how to instantiate the Roku Robot Framework Library:
*** Settings ***
Library ./../Library/RobotLibrary.py  ${ip_address}  ${timeout}  ${pressDelay}   ${server_path}

*** Variables ***
${ip_address} 127.0.0.1
${server_path} D:/path/to/webDriver/main.exe
${timeout} 20000
${pressDelay} 2000

.py file:
class RobotLibrary:

    def __init__(self, ip, timeout = 0, pressDelay = 0,  path = ""):
        <some code>

Sample test cases
The Roku automated app testing repository includes a set of sample Robot Framework test cases that can be executed on their corresponding SceneGraph Developer Extensions (SGDEX) sample apps . For example, you can execute the SGDEX GridView test case ( test_3_Grid.robot ), which will sideload the corresponding sample app ( 3_Grid ) on your device, and then view the test output. You can reference these samples when developing test scripts for the automated testing of your development apps.
Before running a sample test case, you need to update the sideload command in the test case with the Roku device password.
The Basic_tests.robot sample demonstrates how to create a simple test case that checks whether a user is authenticated before playing content using the Roku Robot Framework Library:

Viewing the test case report and log
After you run a test case that uses the Roku Robot Framework Library, you can view the generated report and log files in the specified output directory. The report summarizes the test case and provides statistics on the percentage of individual tests that passed/failed. The log details the success/failure of the individual keywords used in each test case.
