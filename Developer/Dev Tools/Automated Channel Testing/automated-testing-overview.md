Automated app testing overview
Roku app developers can use Roku's test automation software to write and execute test cases, including app purchasing, performance, deep linking, and other certification-related testing. Roku provides custom Selenium -based WebDriver APIs for sending commands to launch apps, send keypresses, and check whether SceneGraph components are present on the screen. Apps can use the WebDriver APIs to control a Roku device, while using a test framework or programming language to create, run, log, and record test cases. To make automated testing even easier, Roku provides Robot and JavaScript libraries and a Postman collection .
Executing test automation allows apps to run state-driven UI testing for a number of scenarios. For example, apps can create a test case that installs an app and launches it with a specific contentID and mediaType to verify that deep linking works. Authenticated apps can execute more complex test cases such as launching an app, trying to play content before authenticating the user, entering valid/invalid credentials, and then trying to play content again.
All test cases can be run simultaneously on multiple Roku devices. This is useful for testing app performance across different models with varying RAM and CPU. It is especially important for certification testing, which requires apps to meet performance criteria that varies for different device types.
Implementing automated testing speeds up app development by reducing the number of manual UI tests that need to be run for simple to complex test cases.
Roku's test automation tools require Roku OS 9.1 or higher.
To test production apps with the Roku test automation tools, you must package the app on your Roku device using the same Roku developer account linked to the production version of the app.
Workflow
Test cases can be written with the Roku Robot Framework Library , Roku JavaScript library , another test framework, or a programming language such as Python, JavaScript, or Go. The test scripts send command requests to the Roku WebDriver via the JSON Wire Protocol .
The Roku WebDriver includes an HTTP server that receives the command requests and an External Control Protocol (ECP) client that translates them into ECP requests, which it then routes to the target device.
The device returns the result of the command and XML data back to the Roku WebDriver, which then passes this information back to the test script as a JSON object (via the WebDriver client application).
The following diagram illustrates the automated app testing workflow:
App UI testing
The Roku WebDriver includes a set of APIs that enable developers to run state-driven UI tests. For example, the RokuWebDriver has an element API to check if a specific SceneGraph component is present on the screen in order to determine whether a specific screen has been loaded. In addition, the Roku Robot Framework and JavaScript libraries have keywords that are mapped to the Roku WebDriver APIs so that developers can execute app UI-based test cases with them.
Getting started
Test the Roku WebDriver following these steps:
Clone the Roku automated app testing repository or download it as a zip file.

Run Roku's Python-based sample WebDriver client application following these steps: a. Download and install Python 3.7 (or higher). Set the version you install as the default version of Python on your computer. b. Download and install the Python package installer ( pip ). c. Install the requests HTTP library for Python, which enables the sample client application to send HTTP 1.1 requests: python -m pip install requests d. Sideload the sample app ( channel.zip ) included in the /automated-channel-testing-master/sample directory. e. Run the sample Web driver client application. Include the IP address of your Roku device as an argument. If the test is successful, "Test Passed" is output in the console. python <path>/automated-channel-testing-master/sample/script/main.py <device-ip-address>

Installing and testing the Robot Framework Library
To install the Roku Robot Framework Library and test it on one or more devices, follow these steps:
Optionally, install the Python version of the Roku Robot Framework Library via a local Python package. This enables you to directly import the Roku Robot Framework library in your Robot test case files. python pip install <path>/automated-channel-testing-master/RobotLibrary

Install the dependencies listed in the /automated-channel-testing-master/RobotLibrary/requirements.txt file: python -m pip install -r /automated-channel-testing-master/RobotLibrary/requirements.txt

Update line 41 of the /automated-channel-testing-master/RobotLibrary/Tests/Basic_tests.robot file with the password of your Roku device.

Run the sample basic Robot test case on a single device. When running the Robot tests and samples, you must run them from the RobotLibrary folder. You must also provide the Roku device IP address and WebDriver server path as variables in the console as demonstrated in the following example: cd RobotLibrary
 python -m robot.run --outputdir Results --variable ip_address:192.168.1.94 --variable server_path:<path>/automated-channel-testing-master/bin/RokuWebDriver_<os|linux|windows.exe> Tests/Basic_tests.robot Alternatively, you can hard code the Roku device IP address and WebDriver server path variables in the /automated-channel-testing-develop/RobotLibrary/Library/variables.py file, and then use the following command: python3 -m robot.run --outputdir Results Tests/Basic_tests.robot

View the generated test case report, which is stored in the specified output directory ( /automated-channel-testing-master/RobotLibrary/Results by default).

Run the sample basic Robot test case on multiple devices following these steps: a. Update the JSON configuration file ( config.json ) in the automated-channel-testing-master/RobotLibrary/multipleDevices directory, which contains the Roku devices to be used for testing, the Web driver server path, test case, and the output directory. Each Roku device is an object that has an arbitrary name and a key-value pair with the device's IP address. Key-value pairs may also be provided for the timeout and keypress delay to be used for the test on that device (these override the global test values specified in the Robot test case). The syntax of the config.json file is as follows: {
 "devices": {
 "Device 1 name": {
 "ip_address": <string>,
 "timeout": <number>,
 "pressDelay": <number>
 },
 "Device 2 name": {
 "ip_address": <string>,
 "timeout": <number>
 }
 },
 "server_path": <string>,
 "test": <string>,
 "outputdir": <string>
 } The following example demonstrates how to write the config.json file: {
 "devices": {
 "Amarillo": {
 "ip_address": "192.168.1.64",
 "timeout": 20000,
 "pressDelay": 2000
 },
 "Littlefield": {
 "ip_address": 192.168.1.16,
 "timeout": 25000,
 "pressDelay": 1000
 }
 },
 "server_path": "/automated-channel-testing-master/bin/RokuWebDriver_<os|linux|windows.exe>,
 "test": "Tests/Basic_tests_multi_device.robot",
 "outputdir": "Results"
 } b. Sideload the sample app ( channel.zip ) in the /automated-channel-testing-master/sample folder. c. Update the /automated-channel-testing-master/RobotLibrary/Library/variables.py file with the IP address of the Roku test device and WebDriver path. d. Run the following console command: cd RobotLibrary
 python multipleDevices/multi.py multipleDevices/config.json e. View the generated test case report and log for each device, which are stored in the specified output directory ( /automated-channel-testing-master/RobotLibrary/Results by default).

Installing and testing the Roku JavaScript Library
To install the Roku JavaScript Library and test it on one or more devices, follow these steps:
Download and install the node.js JavaScript runtime environment.

Download and install the Yarn JavaScript package manager.

Install the dependencies listed in the /automated-channel-testing-master/jsLibrary/package.json file: yarn install

To use the Mocha JavaScript test framework and run tests on multiple devices, globally install Mocha and Mochawesome : yarn global add mocha
yarn global add mochawesome

Update the /automated-channel-testing-master/jsLibrary/tests/test_basic.js file with the following: a. In line 20, update the WebDriver server path. b. In line 27, update the IP address to your Roku device. c. In line 28, update the password.

Run the sample basic JavaScript test case on a single device. When running the JavaScript tests and samples, you must run them from the jsLibrary folder yarn tests/test_basic.js To run the test using Mocha and report the test results with Mochawesome, enter the following command: mocha tests/test_basic.js --reporter mochawesome

View the generated test case report, which is stored in the mochawesome-report directory.

Run the sample basic JavaScript test case on multiple devices following these steps: a. Update the JSON configuration file ( config.json ) in the /automated-channel-testing-master/jsLibrary/multipleDevices directory, which contains the Roku devices to be used for testing, the Web driver server path, test case, and the output directory. Each Roku device is an object that has an arbitrary name and a key-value pair with the device's IP address. Key-value pairs may also be provided for the timeout and keypress delay to be used for the test on that device (these override the global test values specified in the Robot test case). The syntax of the config.json file is as follows: {
 "devices": {
 "Device 1 name": {
 "ip_address": <string>,
 "timeout": <number>,
 "pressDelay": <number>
 },
 "Device 2 name": {
 "ip_address": <string>,
 "timeout": <number>
 }
 },
 "server_path": <string>,
 "test": <string>,
 "outputdir": <string>
 } The following example demonstrates how to write the config.json file: {
 "devices": {
 "Amarillo": {
 "ip_address": "192.168.1.64",
 "timeout": 20000,
 "pressDelay": 2000
 },
 "Littlefield": {
 "ip_address": 192.168.1.16,
 "timeout": 25000,
 "pressDelay": 1000
 }
 },
 "server_path": "/automated-channel-testing-master/bin/RokuWebDriver_<os|linux|windows.exe>,
 "test": "multipleDevices/multiple_devices_test_basics.js",
 "outputdir": "Results"
 } b. Sideload the sample app ( channel.zip ) in the /automated-channel-testing-master/sample folder. c. Run the following console command: node multipleDevices/multi.js config.json d. View the generated test case report and log for each device, which are stored in the specified output directory ( /automated-channel-testing-master/jsLibrary/Results by default).

Postman collection
To import the Postman JSON collection and use it to test the Roku WebDriver API calls, follow these steps:
Download Postman.

Verify that the Roku WebDriver server is running (to start the WebDriver, run the main executable in the /automated-channel-testing-master/src folder).

Sideload the sample app ( channel.zip ) in the /automated-channel-testing-master/sample folder.

In Postman, import the /automated-channel-testing-master/sample/Postman/WebDriver_endpoints Postman collection.

Create a new session. To do this, click the POST create session request, update the IP address to your Roku device, and then click Send .

Execute the requests in the Postman collection to test the Roku WebDriver.

When you have finished testing, send the DEL delete session request to remove the session.
