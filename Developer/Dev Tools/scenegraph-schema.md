Roku SceneGraph XML schema (XSD)
The Roku SceneGraph XML schema ( https://devtools.web.roku.com/schema/RokuSceneGraph.xsd ) describes each SceneGraph component, defines the relationship between nodes, and provides the types, default values, and descriptions for each field within a node. This provides developers with a machine-readable document that can be incorporated into Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and formatting tools.
For example, the schema can be used in an IDE to provide content completion support and a quick assist tool for providing hints.
