Catalog 2.0 API integration guide
Publishers can integrate add-ons in their apps to offer customers premium content, additional apps, and other upgrades and features, and they can bundle add-ons with base subscriptions. By integrating add-ons, customers can complete the purchase of all desired products and features for their subscription online and directly on-device with just a few key presses. This enables publishers to maximize subscription revenue through upsells, without any additional friction in the purchase workflow.
An add-on is defined as a service purchased on top of a base subscription product.
Integrating add-ons entails the following steps:
Creating add-on products in the Developer Dashboard. A product represents a set of content (for example, a premium app or app package) or other features offered by your app. You must upgrade to Product Catalog 2.0 to create add-ons (see Creating the Product Catalog for how to migrate the In-app purchase workflow in the Developer Dashboard to the new Product Catalog 2.0 experience).

Creating purchase options for the add-on. A purchase option specifies the billing frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annual), price, and any free trial or introductory price offers for the add-on product.

Update the app with new ChannelStore APIs that support add-ons.

Creating add-on products
Publishers need to create a product in the Developer Dashboard for each add-on to be offered in their app. To create an add-on product, follow these steps:
In the Developer Dashboard , select Product Catalog under Monetization . You can also select Manage Product Catalog from the drop-down list on the left side of the pages within the Developer Dashboard. The Product Catalog page opens.
From the Product List tab, click Add Product . The Add Product page opens.

Enter the following information for the add-on product: Setting Description Product name Select a locale and then enter the product name. This name is used in Roku Pay reports, and it is displayed to customers for product bundles only. The list of available locales is based on the languages selected in the Channel Properties window . To provide additional localized product names, click Add product name in another language , select a locale, and then enter the localized product name. You can provide one product name per locale. Internet required Accept the default setting, which is Yes . Product Id The internal code for the add-on product. It is an add-on Enable this setting, and then select the prerequisite base products. Add-ons are only accessible in the customer flow if the required base products have already been purchased or are being purchased at the same time as the add-on. Product exclusivity group Product groups are required for each set of mutually exclusive add-ons offered by your app. This enables customers to avoid being double billed for access to the same content or service. If customers cannot purchase this add-on while being entitled to another add-on, enable this. If an add-on has multiple prerequisite base products, those base products must be in a product group.
Click Save and create purchase option to create one or more purchase options for the add-on immediately after saving the product.

Accept the default purchase option, which is Subscription , and then click Continue to create the purchase option for the add-on.

You can create a subscription bundle that includes two base products or a single base product and one or more add-ons. To do this, click Subscription bundle and then select the products to be packaged together from the Product list. You may only select products that are not in the same product group. Click Add another product to bundle to include additional products in the bundle. Add-on products can only be bundled with their prerequisite base products.
Creating purchase options for add-ons
Once you have created an add-on product, you create one or more purchase options for it. A purchase option specifies the billing frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annual), price, and any free trial or introductory price offers for the add-on.
To create a purchase option for an add-on product, follow these steps:
From the Product list, select the add-on product for which you are creating a purchase option.

Configure the following Purchase Details settings:

Purchase detail setting	Description
Channel	Select one or more apps where this add-on purchase option will be available for sale. All the apps that belong to the logged-in administrator (root account) are listed.
Display name	A 30-character maximum name of the purchase option. This name will be displayed to customers in the app's on-device purchasing workflow and in subscription emails sent by Roku.

The name can include letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation marks (UTF-8 characters are not supported for product names in English). The display name should include the name of the app, and it should make it easy for customers to identify the product (for example, "Roku Developers - Ad-Free").

Do not include any billing information in the name (for example, billing frequency, price, or trial/discount); the Roku platform UI will automatically display this information to customers.
Description	An optional description of the add-on purchase option. Select a language, and then enter a description.
SKU	The publisher-specific SKU (or other unique identifier) for the add-on purchase option. This code is used in the Roku Pay APIs and reporting. It cannot be changed after the purchase option is published.

Configure the following Products and billing plan settings: Billing plan setting Description Product Select the add-on product for which you are creating a purchase option. Add-on products are tagged with a blue "ADD-ON" label in the drop-down list. Billing periods Select the billing period for the add-on product: monthly , quarterly , or annual . The billing period for the add-on must be the same as the base product. Regular price Select one of the predefined price tiers for the product. Tiers are used to enforce 99-cent or 49-cent pricing (in USD) on app products.
One to three-digit tier numbers are used for 99-cent pricing. Subtract 1 cent from a tier to get the corresponding price. For example, Tier 1 is 99 cents, Tier 2 is $1.99, Tier 10 is $9.99, Tier 100 is $99.99 and so on. The highest tier is 400 ($399.99). Four-digit tier numbers are used for 49-cent pricing. Append 49 cents to the last digit or last two digits in the tier to get the corresponding price. For example, Tier 1000 is 49 cents, Tier 1001 is $1.49, Tier 1010 is $10.49, Tier 1020 is $20.49, and so on. The highest tier is 1030 ($30.49). Base offer The administrator (root account) can create free trial and introductory price offers for an add-on product. Roku Pay automatically handles the auto-renewals of the trial or discounted offers to paid full-price subscriptions. Separate products do not need to be created for free trial or introductory price offers. A single product may include both a base offer (the standard base price) and a trial/discount offer.Select one of the following base offers:
None (default). The purchase option does not include an offer. Free trial . Include a free trial period with the purchase option. In the Trial length box, enter the number of days or months in the trial offer and then select the unit of time ( Days or Months ). Introductory price . Include a discount with the purchase option. In the Introductory period box, enter the number of days, months, or years the introductory price is valid, and then select the pricing tier corresponding to the discounted price to be offered from the Price list. Discounts cannot be specified using percentages or absolute currency units (for example, USD). Discounts may only be specified using the appropriate price tier. For example, the absolute discount from tier 9 to tier 6 is $3.00 ($8.99-5.99); the percentage discount is 33.4% ($(1-(5.99/8.99))x100).
Click Save as Draft to save the purchase option without publishing it. Click Publish to activate the purchase option on your app.

If you selected Publish in step 6, review the Purchase details and Billing plan settings, and then click Confirm to make the purchase option available to customers on your app. After you create an add-on, you can schedule limited-time offers and schedule price changes for it (see Creating the Product Catalog for how to do this).

Updating the app
Publishers need to update their app's code to leverage the new GetAllPurchases , GetCatalog , QueryPuchaseOptions , and DoOrder ChannelStore APIs, which have been enhanced for supporting add-ons. These APIs are summarized as follows (See Appendix A for the Add-on API reference):
GetAllPurchases : Lists the current (and optionally historical) products and purchase options associated with the Roku customer account. The v2 GetAllPurchases command includes a new includesExpired flag that enables you to get the historical purchases associated with the customer account. As a result, the getAllPurchases command is not used for this integration.

GetCatalog : Retrieves the list of products and purchase options in the app.

QueryPuchaseOptions : Takes the new purchase option map and product map objects returned by the GetPurchases and GetCatalog commands and returns a list of purchase options matching the specified query. This command helps developers determine which purchase options to offer to customers (it replaces the complex BrightScript mapping login used in earlier versions of this integration).

DoOrder : Displays the Roku Pay order confirmation screen where customers complete their subscription and add-on purchase.

The new versions of these ChannelStore APIs use Roku's generic request framework, which enables developers to pass the ChannelStore command, parameters, and context into a single request object (an associative array). The result of the request is encapsulated in a requestStatus object (also an associative array), which includes the status of the request and the data returned by it. Channels must observe the requestStatus field to be notified of changes and fire a callback function to parse and process the Channel Store API commands.
To update your app with the new Channel Store APIs, follow these steps:
Initialize the ChannelStore API generic request framework. The following code monitors the channelStore.requestStatus field and fires the onRequestStatus() callback function when changes to the requestStatus field occur. The onRequestStatus() function determines which command was sent and sends the results to the dedicated parser for the command.

   function init()
       m.store = m.parent.FindNode("channelStore")
       m.store.observeField("requestStatus", "onRequestStatus")
   end function

   ' Generic SDK API request callback
   function onRequestStatus()
       requestStatus = m.store.requestStatus

       if requestStatus = Invalid
           print "Invalid requestStatus"
       else
           print "requestStatus", requestStatus
           print "requestStatus.command", requestStatus.command
           print "requestStatus.status", requestStatus.status
           print "requestStatus.statusMessage", requestStatus.statusMessage
           print "requestStatus.context", requestStatus.context

           ' requestStatus.status:
           ' 2: Interrupted
           ' 1: Success
           ' 0: Network error
           ' -1: HTTP Error/Timeout
           ' -2: Timeout
           ' -3: Unknown error
           ' -4: Invalid request

           ' Generic request succeeded
           if requestStatus.status = 1 then
               if requestStatus.command = "GetCatalog" then
                   onGetCatalog(requestStatus.result)
               else if requestStatus.command = "QueryPurchaseOptions" then
                   onQueryPurchaseOptions(requestStatus.context, requestStatus.result)
               else if requestStatus.command = "DoOrder" then
                   onOrderStatus(requestStatus.result)
               else if requestStatus.command = "GetPurchases" then
                   onGetPurchases(requestStatus.result)
               end if
           end if
       end if
   end function

Send the GetCatalog command to get the list of purchase options. In all the requests within the add-on API workflow, the version field must be set to 2 .

   sub GetCatalog()
       request = {}
       request.command = "GetCatalog"
       request.params = {
           "version": 2
       }
       m.store.request = request
   end sub

From the OnGetCatalog() callback function, store the purchaseOptionsMap and productsMap collections returned by the GetCatalog command.

   sub onGetCatalog(requestResult as object)
       print "requestResult.status", requestResult.status
       print "requestResult.statusMessage", requestResult.statusMessage

       m.purchaseOptions = {}
       m.products = {}

       ' GetCatalog succeeded
       if requestResult.status = 1 and type(requestResult.result) = "roAssociativeArray" then
           m.purchaseOptions = requestResult.result.purchaseOptionsMap
           m.products = requestResult.result.productsMap
       end if
   end sub

Use the QueryPurchaseOptions command to offer the customer base and bundle purchase options in the UI. The following example creates a map of base and bundle purchase options:

   sub queryBasePurchaseOptions()
       query = [
           {"billingType":"Subscription","base":true},
           {"billingType":"Subscription","bundle":true}
       ]
       QueryPurchaseOptions("Base", query)
   end sub

   sub QueryPurchaseOptions(queryType as String, query as Object)
       request = {
           "context": {
               "queryType": queryType
           }
           "params": {
               "purchaseOptionsMap": m.purchaseOptions
               "productsMap": m.products
               "query": query
           }
           "command": "QueryPurchaseOptions"
       }
       m.store.request = request
   end sub

   sub onQueryPurchaseOptions(context as object, requestResult as object)
       if context.queryType = "Base" then
           m.basePurchaseOptions = requestResult.purchaseOptionsMap
           offerBasePurchaseOptions()
       else if context.queryType = "Addon" then
           m.addonPurchaseOptions = requestResult.purchaseOptionsMap
           offerAddonPurchaseOptions()
       end if
   end sub

Offer the customer add-on purchase options in the UI. The following example creates a map of add-on purchase options that are available for the specified SKU of a base purchase option:

   sub queryAddonPurchaseOptions()
          query = [
              {"referenceSku":m.base,"addon":true}
          ]
          QueryPurchaseOptions("Addon", query)
      end sub

      sub onQueryPurchaseOptions(context as object, requestResult as object)
          if context.queryType = "Base" then
              m.basePurchaseOptions = requestResult.purchaseOptionsMap
              offerBasePurchaseOptions()
          else if context.queryType = "Addon" then
              m.addonPurchaseOptions = requestResult.purchaseOptionsMap
              offerAddonPurchaseOptions()
          end if
   end sub

Send the DoOrder command to purchase the base prerequisite product and any add-ons, and then check the order status.

   sub DoOrder()
       request = {}
       request.command = "DoOrder"
       orderItems = []
       if m.content.base <> "" then
           orderItems.push({
               "sku" : m.content.base
               "qty" : 1
           })
       end if
       for each addon in m.content.addons
           orderItems.push({
               "sku" : addon
               "qty" : 1
           })
       end for
       request.params = {
           "version": 2
           "orderItems": orderItems
       }
       m.store.request = request
   end sub
   function onOrderStatus(requestResult as object) as void
       print chr(10) + "onOrderStatus"
       dialog = CreateObject("roSGNode", "statusDialog")
       message = ""
       if requestResult.status <> 1
           message = "status: " + str(requestResult.status) + chr(10)
           message += "statusMessage: " + requestResult.statusMessage
       else
           message = "Your Purchase completed successfully" + chr(10)
           message += "statusMessage: " + requestResult.statusMessage + chr(10)
           if type(requestResult.result) = "roAssociativeArray" then
               purchases = requestResult.result.purchases
               ' roArray
               if type(purchases) = "roArray" then
                   for i = 0 to purchases.Count() - 1

                           print "item.replacedPurchase", item.replacedPurchase
                       end if
                       keys = item.Keys()

                           if strField <> Invalid
                               if strField.len() > 0

Appendix B: Roku Pay Web Services updates
The new catalog data structure has not changed any of the Roku Pay web service API contracts. The fields returned by the Roku Pay APIs remain the same. The only change is that the values included in the productId and productName fields now reference the purchase option associated with the transaction, instead of the product .
Publishers should map the values returned in the productName and productId fields, which reference the purchase option, to the associated products in their backend system
Appendix C: On-device add-on purchase workflow
When the DoOrder command is sent, the Roku Pay order confirmation screen lists each product being purchased, including base subscriptions and add-ons.
If the purchase includes two or more add-ons, the customer can press the PLAY button on their Roku remote control to view an itemized list of products before confirming the purchase.
Appendix D: Base subscription and add-on management workflow for customers
Customers can cancel their base subscriptions and add-ons either directly on-device or online from Roku's Subscription management page.
At least one base prerequisite product must be active in order for an add-on product to remain active as well. If no base prerequisite products are active, the add-on product is cancelled. For example, if the customer cancels the prerequisite base product (and is not entitled to any other prerequisites), the add-on is also canceled.
If a customer upgrades/downgrades a base prerequisite subscription product, the add-on remains active only if the upgrade/downgrade transaction includes a different prerequisite base product and that same add-on. For example, customers can sign up for one base prerequisite and an add-on, and then upgrade to a second base prerequisite product (the upgrade transaction must include the new base product and the same add-on), and then downgrade back to the first (the downgrade transaction must include the new base product and the same add-on), without access to the add-on being interrupted.
When an add-on is canceled, its entitlement is removed from the Roku customer account at the next billing cycle (no refunds are given for partial-term cancellations)
When a customer upgrades/downgrades their base subscription product and retains one or more add-ons linked to that base product, you must include those retained add-ons in the DoOrder request.
