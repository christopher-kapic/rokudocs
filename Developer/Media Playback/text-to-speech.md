Text to speech components
Components available since Roku OS 7.2
Text to speech (TTS) allows the developer to provide an audible spoken version of
the strings shown to the user in the app. For platforms that
are required to comply with the FCC Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 (CVAA) ,
this capability can be used as part of compliance with CVAA, and the
current text to speech flite_tts library is built into the image. The
Roku text to speech capability supports different languages, voices,
rates of speech, volume of speech, and other aspects of text to speech.
Roku provides text to speech support in the following components,
interfaces, and events:
roTextToSpeech
ifTextToSpeech
roTextToSpeechEvent

Components available since Roku OS 7.5
roAudioGuide
ifAudioGuide

Implementation tips
TTS interruptions
Many UI elements have default TTS behavior. It is possible that
speech triggered by these implementations can interrupt your TTS
implementation at times. You should keep track of the IDs of your TTS
utterances, as returned by say() and silence(), and handle interruptions
accordingly.
Other TTS implementation changes
Other TTS implementations may change the current voice, the current
language, the current volume, the current pitch, and/or the current
speech rate. You should keep track of how these parameters might change.
Long text delays
A long text string to be spoken by TTS may have a noticeable delay
before starting the speech, at least for the first speech of the long
string. For long text strings, you can break up the text string so that
the first speech is a reasonably short sentence, followed by longer
sentences as needed. You should not break up the long text string into
individual words, as it will affect phrasing without improving the
perceived delay in any noticeable way.
