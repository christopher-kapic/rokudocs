Certification criteria
To ensure that the Roku platform provides a consistent, performant experience for customers, Roku reserves the right to review all new and updated public apps in the Roku Streaming Store for design and performance criteria. This certification process confirms that apps properly integrate applicable Roku platform requirements.
Roku reserves the right to remove published apps from the Roku Streaming Store at any time if they do not maintain compliance with the requirements specified in this document, per the Roku Distribution Agreement (or other applicable distribution agreement).
Preparing for certification
Use the following guidelines to develop, test, and submit your new or updated app for certification.
Developing apps
Use current APIs
Using deprecated APIs may cause your app to fail certification testing. See the list of deprecated APIs .
Testing apps
Test apps before submission
Use the certification criteria and the list of pre-certification tests as tools to guide certification-compliance testing. Roku also provides a suite of tools to help developers verify that their apps comply with Roku's certification criteria before being submitting them for certification:
Static Analysis tool : Checks the app's code for certification-related errors.
Channel Behavior Analysis tool : For SVOD, AVOD, and free apps, verifies whether app performance and deep linking meet applicable certification requirements.
Test automation software : Enables developers to write and execute automated test cases, including app purchasing, performance, deep linking, and other certification criteria.

Test using beta apps
Roku provides developers with an access code for distributing beta versions of apps during development and testing. You can use beta apps to preview the most recently uploaded version of the app (app updates are not reviewed for certification until they have been submitted for certification).
Test across multiple device types
You must test the app on multiple Roku device models before submitting for certification. Your test suite should include a combination of Roku models with varying processing power and memory. This is because your apps must be performant on all Roku device models that currently receive OS updates. For more information on current and updatable Roku device models, see the Hardware specifications .
Submitting apps for certification
Provide required resources and information
As part of the app publishing flow, you must provide the following resources to submit an app for publishing:
Roku Streaming Store information : You must provide a name, description, and poster (a 540x405 JPEG or PNG image) in each language supported by your app. The app name must clearly identify the company associated with the service. You must have full legal rights or consent for their app names and the rights to all trademarks and copyright expressions associated with the name. The app naming must not include or use the Roku name, nor may it contain any profane, derogatory, or misleading language.

Authorized ad seller information : Ad-supported apps must provide the URL path to an app-ads.txt file to secure the app's ad inventory. The app-ads.txt file is an industry protocol maintained by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) that establishes a public record of digital sellers authorized to sell advertisements against your inventory. If requested, you must add Roku as an authorized seller to your app-ads.txt file, per provided instructions. If your app does not sell ads through third parties or does not run programmatic ads on its inventory, Roku recommends that you include the following line in the app-ads.txt file: # [Channel Name] does not authorize programmatic sellers .

Contact and support information : You must provide the following contact information for your app: Customer support (URL, email address, and phone number). Administrative and technical leads (names, email addresses, and phone numbers [with country codes]).

Run certification tests
Once you’ve finished QA testing your app and have packaged it, you can begin the certification process by running Static Analysis and Channel Behavior Analysis Testing on your app in the Developer Dashboard. The Static Analysis tool checks the structure and syntax of your app's code for common problems related to certification requirements. This tool lists any errors requiring resolution before the app can be scheduled for publishing. The Channel Behavior Analysis tool, which is only available to free, ad-supported, and subscription apps, launches the app and checks for state-driven results to verify compliance with Roku's certification criteria. TVE, TVOD, PVOD, and vMVPD apps must include login credentials with their app certification submission.
For self-published apps, once your app has passed Static Analysis and Channel Behavior Analysis Testing, you can schedule the publishing process start date.
Once your app is scheduled for publishing, it is submitted to Roku for final review. If Roku does not find any issues with your app, it will be published on the date and time you have scheduled. If issues are found, an email that lists them is forwarded to the developer account associated with the app.
If additional certification testing is required, you should expect to receive feedback on your app within a week following submission. Apps requiring additional testing are reviewed in the order they are received.
For step-by-step instructions on submitting an app, see Publishing Roku Apps .
Updating apps
If you update the implementation code for an existing app, the app must be re-certified and re-published. Changing the content that the app streams does not require re-certification and re-publishing.
Certification policy
Platform and model constraints
The support requirements for the Roku platform and associated device models are:
The app must be available on all Roku device models that receive the current Roku OS.
All content from the app service must be available on all Roku device models.

A comprehensive list of Roku device models and platform code names can be found in the Hardware specifications .
Streaming hour thresholds
All requirements with streaming hours thresholds are stated as an average number of hours per month over the past three months. For example, if a requirement states that it is applicable to apps that average 5 million streaming hours per month over the past three months, apps that have accumulated a total of 15 million streaming hours or more during the past three months must adhere to that requirement. In addition, all requirements with streaming hours thresholds are applicable to new apps projected to reach the specified thresholds shortly after launch.
