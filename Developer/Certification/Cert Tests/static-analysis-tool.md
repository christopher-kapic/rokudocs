Static Analysis tests
Apps must pass Static Analysis testing in order to published to the Streaming Store. Apps cannot be submitted for publishing without passing static analysis testing.
The Static Analysis tool , which is a part of the app builder flow in the Developer Dashboard, enables developers to verify that their app's BrightScript source code complies with Roku certification criteria. The tool checks whether the app's code contains any of the following certification-related errors:
