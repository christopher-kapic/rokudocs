Channel behavior analysis tests
Subscription (SVOD), ad-supported (AVOD), and free apps must pass automated certification testing in order to published to the Streaming Store. Apps cannot be submitted for publishing without passing automated certification testing.
The Channel Behavior Analysis tool , which is a part of the app builder flow in the Developer Dashboard, enables developers to run self-serve automated certification tests on their apps. The tool verifies whether apps meet the following performance and deep linking certification requirements:
Test case	Certification requirement tested	Date added
App launch performance	The app launches to a fully rendered homescreen within 15 seconds on the Roku Streaming Stick+ (Amarillo-2019 3810X) or 20 seconds on the Roku Express (Littlefield 37XXX).

You must add a signal beacon to your application to measure launch times. Once you add the beacon, you can use the debug console to verify that your app's launch time is meeting this requirement.	July 2020
Deep linking	App supports deep linking for all media types (including "series"), per Roku's deep linking policy . When the app is already running, app uses roInputEvent to send direct playback commands to the app and deep link to content.	July 2020
Content playback performance	Content starts playing within 8 seconds of initiation on the Roku Streaming Stick+ (Amarillo-2019 3810X) or 10 seconds on the Roku Express (Littlefield 37XXX).

If your app is using the Roku video player, the Roku OS automatically fires beacons to measure and record the video start time; therefore, no additional implementation work for your application is required. If your app is using a custom video player, your application must fire the video start beacons.	July 2020
Focused Full-Screen Video Playback	App keeps focus on the Video node during full-screen video playback when there are no active UI components over the video.	August 2023
Screensaver policy	App does not override or interfere with Roku's system screensaver. See Roku’s Screensaver Policy .	December 2023
