Pre-certification tests
These tests describe the specific behavior and attributes an app must demonstrate to pass Roku's certification process. Use this list to create tests for your channel during development. See Certification for more information on policies and processes as you prepare for certification.
To help developers test their channels, Roku provides a suite of tools to ensure your channel complies with the certification criteria. The test suite includes the following tools:
Static Analysis tool : Checks the channel's code for certification-related errors.
Channel Behavior Analysis tool : For SVOD, AVOD, and free channels, verifies channel performance and deep linking meets certification requirements.
Test automation software : Enables developers to write and execute automated test cases, including channel purchasing, performance, deep linking, and other certification criteria.

Developers are expected to use these tools, the certification criteria , and the list of certification tests in this document to guide internal quality assurance testing before submitting an app to Roku for review .
1. Advertising
1.1 Apps that include video advertising must comply with all the integration requirements listed in Roku advertising requirements document.
Tests : App is meeting the criteria specified in 1.1.
Expected Result : All ads are served via the Roku Advertising Framework (RAF) whether the channel is using the Roku default ad server or a third-party ad server (for example, Google DoubleClick for Publishers [DFP]. Freewheel, and so on). Ads render as expected on all Roku devices.
RAF 1.1 Apps must integrate the Roku Advertising Framework (RAF) for all ads without modifying, obstructing, or disabling RAF functionality in any way. Replays of live broadcast streams are exempt from this requirement, unless dynamic ad insertion is used to insert new ads.
RAF 1.2 All measurement beacons must be fired client-side via RAF. See the Roku Advertising Watermark integration guide for more information.
RAF 1.3 Apps in the U.S. Roku Streaming Store only that are not child-directed must support Roku ad tracking by calling the enableAdMeasurements() method and passing the required content metadata within the following methods: setContentGenre() , setContentId() , and setContentLength() . Optionally, channels may use the setNielsenGenre API to pass specific Nielsen Genre granularity and the setNielsenChannelId API for those who specify a custom Nielsen Channel ID. The enableAdMeasurements method deprecates the enableNielsenDAR API; therefore, do not use the enableNielsenDAR API.
Tests :
Get a test ad that contains trackers for Nielsen DAR and Comscore vCE. The method for getting the test ad varies based on whether you are implementing ads client-side via RAF or server-side: Client-side: Call the setAdUrl method with no parameters. Server-side: Email adsupport@roku.com with a request for an ad request URL, and then traffic the ad request URL on your ad server.
Generate a debug console log as described in Debugging Your application.
Confirm the correct word appears in the log.

Expected Result :
Nielsen DAR contains imrworldwide in the subdomain, and the following content metadata and Nielsen data that you passed: c45 = <Content Duration> c13 = <Nielsen Channel ID> c43 = <Nielsen Program ID> c44 = <Nielsen Genre>

Comscore vCE Contains scorecardresearch in the subdomain and the following content metadata that you passed : ns_st_ge = <Content Genre> ns_st_pr = <Content ID> ns_st_cd = <Content Length>

RAF 1.4 Apps must display the number of ads during ad breaks using the standard Roku-branded label channellied by RAF for all ads inserted client-side.
Tests :
Play any video from the beginning to invoke the pre-roll ads.
When an ad break appears, verify that the number of ads in the ad break is displayed in the upper left/right corner of the screen.
Play the same video until the mid-roll ads are invoked. Verify again that the number of ads in the ad break are displayed on the screen.

Expected Result :
The number of ads in the ad break are displayed during the ad break using the standard Roku-branded label channellied by RAF.
ADS 1.1 Apps must disclose integration/use of all non-Roku SDKs, libraries, or other software systems and external advertising partners (e.g., DSPs) that enable video, audio, or banner ad insertion. Roku has the right to approve or deny such non-Roku SDKs, libraries, or other software systems.
Tests : App is meeting the criteria specified in 1.2.
Expected Result : App does not contain any undisclosed third-party SDKs, libraries, or other software systems that enable video, audio, or banner ad insertion.
ADS 1.2 Apps that have an inventory relationship with Roku must meet the advertising terms specified in all applicbale agreements. See Video Advertisements for more information.
Tests : App is meeting the criteria specified in 1.3.
Expected Result : App is meeting the contactually-specified terms for ad requests and performance. You can review your contract with publisheradservices@roku.com to ensure the channel is meeting the specified terms.
ADS 1.3 Apps selling ads must comply with Roku's ad load, ad frequency, and acceptable ad requirements. See Roku Advertising Guidelines for more information.
Tests : Apps can obtain the user agent from the client-side call made to their ad stitcher or ad server, and then pass it into the User-Agent header in the server-side ad request, without any modifications.
Expected Result : Per the Roku Advertising Guidelines , ad breaks are at least 7 minutes apart and contain no more than 2 minutes of ads. This helps ensure a positive viewing experience of content that is being monitized with ads (regardless if the ads are supplied by Roku or a third-party provider).
ADS 1.4 Apps in the U.S. Roku Streaming Store that have both streamed more than an average of 100,000 hours per month and averaged more than 10,000 new installs per month over the last three months may be required to implement the Demand API as part of their integration (this requirement may also be applicbale to new channels projected to reach the specified thresholds shortly after launch).
Apps outside the U.S. Roku Streaming Store that have streamed more than an average of 200,000 hours per month over the last three months, and new channels outside the U.S. Roku Streaming Store that are projected to reach this threshold, may also be required to implement the Demand API. See Implementing the Demand API .
Tests : App is meeting the criteria specified in ADS 1.1.
Expected Result : Apps meeting the streaming hours threshold have integrated the Demand API.
ADS 1.5 Authenticated ad-monetized channels must use the getUserData command to display a Request For Information (RFI) screen during the sign-up and sign-in workflows to enable customers to share their Roku account information with the channel. Only if the user declines the request may channels require the customer to manually enter their information.
Tests :
Follow the instructions within the channel on how to sign up and sign in.
Verify whether the Request For Information (RFI) screen appears during the sign-up and sign-in flows.

Expected Result : The RFI screen is displayed on the channel, prompting the user to grant Roku access to share their information with the channel. A form for customers to manually enter their information is only displayed if the user declines to share their information.
ADS 2.1 App must pass Roku's ID for Advertisers (RIDA) and "limit ad tracking" (LAT) value on ad server requests. If the user has opted out, channels must still pass the temporary ID returned by the rodeviceInfo.GetRida() function to support frequency cchanneling (this temporary ID is different than the UUID returned if the user has not opted out; it expires after 30 days). See GetRida() , IsRIDADisabled()asBoolean , and the URL parameter macros populated by RAF
Tests : RIDA and LAT values may be passed on ad server requests client-side via RAF or server-side. Use one of the following tests corresponding to how you pass RIDA and LAT values in ad server requests:
Client-side via RAF: Place the URL parameter macros populated by RAF in ad request urls to populate the RIDA and LAT in the appropriate spot. Sideload the channel , Telnet into the Roku device , and then enable RAF debug mode . Observe that RAF requests a test url and dispatches trackers on sideloaded channels when setAdUrl is passed an empty value.
Server-side: For server-side ad requests, the ad server's runtime macros are typically used to pass the RIDA and LAT values in the ad requests instead of the RAF macros. In this case, the RIDA and LAT values are usually passed to the ad server via Roku API calls. Check your ad server for the runtime macros to be used to pass the RIDA and LAT values. Email adsupport@roku.com for help with this process. Call the GetRida() and IsRidaDisabled() methods to pass the RIDA and LAT values to your ad server, respectively.

Expected Result : The RIDA and LAT are passed on all client-side and server-side ad requests.
The RIDA is Roku's Identifier for Advertising (IFA) , similar to the Google Advertising ID (ADID) or Apple Identifier for Advertising (IDFA).
LAT is often referred to as the Do Not Track (DNT) or the User Opt Out (UOO).
The RIDA and LAT are used together to ensure that the users' privacy settings are respected.
ADS 2.2 Apps with child-directed content must make ad requests that indicate that content is child-directed when serving ads during child-directed content. See the kidsContent parameter in the setContentGenre() method and the ROKU_ADS_KIDS_CONTENT URL parameter macro .
Tests : App is meeting the criteria specified in ADS 2.2.
Expected Result : Ad requests include flag indicating whether content is child-directed.
ADS 3.1 Apps must pass their Roku channel ID in ad server requests to Roku. See the roChannelInfo.getId() function and the ROKU_ADS_APP_ID URL parameter macro populated by RAF .
Tests : The Roku channel ID may be passed on ad server requests client-side via RAF or server-side. Use one of the following tests corresponding to how you pass Roku channel ID values in ad server requests:
Client-side via RAF: Place the ROKU_ADS_APP_ID URL parameter macro populated by RAF in ad request urls to populate the Roku channel ID in the appropriate spot. Sideload the channel , Telnet into the roku device , and then enable RAF debug mode . Observe that RAF requests a test url and dispatches trackers on sideloaded channels when setAdUrl is passed an empty value.
Server-side: For server-side ad requests, the ad server's runtime macros are typically used to pass the Roku channel ID in the ad requests instead of the RAF macros. In this case, the Roku channel ID is usually passed to the ad server via Roku API calls. Check your ad server for the runtime macros to be used to pass the Roku channel ID. Email adsupport@roku.com for help with this process. Call the roChannelInfo.getId() method methods to pass the Roku channel ID to your ad server.

Expected Result : The Roku channel ID ("dev") is passed on all client-side and server-side ad requests to Roku when testing your sideloaded channel.
ADS 3.2 Apps must use the Roku-generated device user agent in all server-side ad requests. See the RAF integration guide for more details.
Tests :
Obtain the user agent from a client-side call made to your ad stitcher or ad server.
Pass the user agent into the User-Agent header in the server-side ad request, without any modifications.
Verify that the User-Agent header in the server-side ad request includes the same Roku-generated device user agent obtained via the client-side call made to your ad stitcher or ad server.

Expected Result : All server-side ad requests include the Roku-generated device user agent, without any modification.
ADS 4.1 All channels (except those streaming live content or replaying live broadcast streams) must return to the previous screen when the back button is pressed during an ad break (if the channel can't return to the previous screen, the channel displays an exit confirmation dialog). Apps must attempt to initiate an ad break to preserve the previously exited ad experience when playback resumes (with the same or different content).
Tests : Verify ads in the channel cannot be skipped by any mechanism, such as pressing the back button to exit a video and then resuming it.
Expected Result : Ads may not be skipped by pressing the back button or any other mechanism.
ADS 4.2 All channels (except those streaming live content or replaying live broadcast streams) must ignore FF/REW commands received during an ad break (via either key presses or voice commands).
Tests : Verify ads in the channel cannot be skipped by any mechanism, such as pressing the FF/REW buttons or sending a FF/REW voice command.
Expected Result : Ads may not be skipped by pressing the FF/REW buttons, sending a FF/REW voice command, or any other mechansim.
