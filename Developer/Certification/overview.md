Channel certification overview
All public channels must meet Roku's certification criteria to be published to the Roku Channel Store. This ensures that all channels in the Roku Channel Store have properly integrated required platform features in order to provide viewers a consistent user experience.
Channel testing
Roku provides a suite of tools and tests to help developers check whether their channel complies with the certification criteria :
Static Analysis tool : Checks the channel's code for certification-related errors.
Channel Behavior Analysis tool : Verifies that the channel meets performance and deep linking requirements. This tool may be used for SVOD, AVOD, and free channels.
Channel pre-certification tests : Provides a list of tests that channels can run during development to prepare for Roku's channel certification process.

Developers are expected to use the Static Analysis and Channel Behavior Analysis tool tools, the list of pre-certification tests , and the certification criteria to guide internal quality assurance testing before submitting an channel to Roku for review and publishing.
