Optimized data transfer and reference handling
Roku OS 15.0 includes new APIs for populating node fields by moving rather than copying associative arrays. These new APIs overcome the traditional performance issues posed by setting or getting the large associative array fields of nodes. On the render thread, data can now be efficiently accessed by reference rather than copying. In addition, rendezvous blocking in task node threads can now be avoided by passing messages asynchronously to the queue of the render thread.
The following list breaks down these new data transfer and reference handling APIs introduced in Roku OS 15.0:
Moving data roSGNode.MoveIntoField(field_name as String, data as Object) as Integer roSGNode.MoveFromField(field_name as String) as Object
Referencing data roSGNode.SetRef(field_name as String, data as Object) roSGNode.CanGetRef(field_name as String) as Boolean roSGNode.GetRef(field_name as String) as Object
Using data utilities roUtils.DeepCopy(data as Object) as Object roUtils.IsSameObject(data1 as Object, data2 as Object) as Boolean
Queueing data message handlers roRenderThreadQueue.AddMessageHandler(message_id as String, handler as String) as Object roRenderThreadQueue.PostMessage(message_id as String, data as Object) roRenderThreadQueue.CopyMessage(message_id as String, data as Object) roRenderThreadQueue.NumCopies() as Integer

Moving data
roSGNode.MoveIntoField(field_name as String, data as Object) as Integer
Description
Moves an object into an roSGNode field, which must be an associative array. If the destinaton field is not an associative array, the call fails. When the move succeeds, the source object is empty after the call. This function may be called from any thread.
If the source object has any nested objects with external references, those nested objects are copied instead of moved.
If this function is called on a task node thread for an object that is not owned by the task thread, a rendezvous occurs.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
field_name	String	The target field (an associativeArray) of the node where you want to move the source object.
data	Object	The source object to be moved.

Return Value
The number of nested objects within an object that were copied, rather than moved, because of external references.
Example
' Can be on Task thread or render thread
  n = CreateObject("roSGNode", "Node")
  n.AddField("aa_field", "assocarray", true)
  my_aa = { key: "value" }
  n.MoveIntoField("aa_field", my_aa)
  ? n.aa_field
  ? my_aa

This code will output the following on the port 8085 console:
<Component: roAssociativeArray> =
{
    key: "value"
}
<Component: roAssociativeArray> =
{
}

Performance improvement
Using the MoveIntoField() and MoveFromField() functions is significantly faster than standard field copy operations ( node.field = value , Update , AddFields , and so on). This is because the data is moved and no copies are used (unless external references are present).
roSGNode.MoveFromField(field_name as String) as Object
Moves data out of a field. The field must be of type assocarray .
Moves an object out of an roSGNode field (an associative array). If the source field is not an associative array, the call fails. When the move succeeds, the source field is empty after the call. This function may be called from any thread.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
field_name	String	The source field that contains the associative array to be moved.

Return Value
The associative array that was moved from the source field.
Example
n = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ContentNode")
n.AddField("aa_field", "assocarray", true)
n.aa_field = { key: "value"}' or use moveIntoField()
my_aa = n.MoveFromField("aa_field")
? n.aa_field ' invalid
? my_aa ' contents of aa_field

Moving data - when it copies instead
The move operations ( PostMessage and MoveIntoField ) remove the contents from the source object and move them across to the destination. This clears out the source object. For example:
aa = {foo: "hello", bar: [1, 2, 3]}
node.moveIntoField("myfield", aa)
? aa           ' Prints an empty AA

However, if nested objects within the source object contain external references, those nested objects are not moved, and they are preserved by copying them instead.
The following example is the same as the above, except a nested object contains an external reference. As a result, the nested object is copied to the destination rather than being moved.
sub_array = [1, 2, 3]
aa = {foo: "hello", bar: sub_array}
' At this point, there is an external reference into aa
node.moveIntoField("myfield", aa)
? aa           ' Prints an empty AA
? sub_array    ' Prints [1,2,3] - this was preserved

Accessing fields by reference
You can access fields by reference instead of copying their values. This is significantly faster than copying; however, you can only do this on the render thread for fields with an associative array type. Access by reference cannot be used when queuing fields, and you must explicity set references before getting them.
Function references
You can store a function reference in a field and then access it by reference. The function reference can then be passed to other components. As a result of a SceneGraph component namespacing, however, the function that is called is not the one that was referenced in the original component.
The behavior of passing function references in this manner may change in a future release; therefore, developers should not build any dependencies on it.
roSGNode.SetRef(field_name as String, data as Object)
Description
Assigns an associative array to the field of a roSGNode via reference. This avoids the expense of copying when directly assigning a field to the value.
This function may only be called on the render thread.
Field observers are not notified when this function is called.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
field_name	String	The name of the node's field to be assigned the associative array.
data	Object	The associative array to be referenced by the field.

Return Value
This function returns true if successful; otherwise it return false, indicating that the reference could not be set.
roSGNode.CanGetRef(field_name as String) as Boolean
Description
Indicates whether the GetRef() function will succeed in the current context. The GetRef() call will only succeed if is called on the render thread and the SetRef() function had previoulsy been called on the field_name .
The specified field_name must be an associative array, and it must have previously been given a value via SetRef() .
The CanGetRef() function may only be called on the render thread. This function cannot be used if queueFields has been enabled.
Return Value
This function returns true if the call to the GetRef() function will succeed in the current context.
roSGNode.GetRef(field_name as String) as Object
Description
Returns a reference to the value of an roSGNode field, which must be an associative array. If the field is not an associative array, the call fails. The specified field must have previously been given a value via SetRef() .
The GetRef() function may only be called on the render thread. This function cannot be used if queueFields has been enabled.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
field_name	String	The name of the node's field to be referenced.

Return Value
This function returns a reference to the field’s value. This function returns <invalid> if accessing the field via reference is not valid.
Example
' on render thread:
    n = CreateObject("roSGNode", "Node")
    n.AddField("aa_field", "assocarray", true)
    my_aa = { key: "value" }
    n.setRef("aa_field", my_aa)
    ? n.aa_field
    ? my_aa
    ? n.GetRef("aa_field")

This code will output the following on the port 8085 console:
<Component: roAssociativeArray> =
{
    key: "value"
}
<Component: roAssociativeArray> =
{
    key: "value"
}
<Component: roAssociativeArray> =
{
    key: "value"
}

Using utilities to copy data
The roUtils component provides a unique namespace for a library of global functions, including the DeepCopy() function for copying objects and their nested objects and the isSameObject() function for checking whether two BrightScript objects refer to the same instance.
roUtils.DeepCopy(data as Object) as Object
Description
Performs a deep copy of the source node object (it copies the obejct and all of its nested objects). If the source object contains items that are not copyable, they are skipped.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
data	Object	The object to be copied

Return Value
This function returns a copy of the specified object.
Example
utils = CreateObject("roUtils")
    di = CreateObject("roDeviceInfo")
    aa = { a: 1, b: { b1: 42 }, c: di }
    new_aa = utils.DeepCopy(aa)
    ? "IsSameObject", utils.IsSameObject(aa, new_aa)
    ? "new_aa.a", new_aa.a
    ? "new_aa.b", new_aa.b
    ? "new_aa.c", new_aa.c ' invalid, roDeviceInfo is not copyable

This code will output the following on the port 8085 console:
IsSameObject    false
new_aa.a         1
new_aa.b        <Component: roAssociativeArray> =
{
    b1: 42
}
new_aa.c        invalid

roUtils.IsSameObject(data1 as Object, data2 as Object) as Boolean
Description
Checks whether two BrightScript objects refer to the same instance and returns a flag indicating the result.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
data1	Object	First object
data2	Object	Second object

Return Value
Returns true if data1 and data2 reference the same object; otherwise, this returns false.
Example
shared = {}
    aa = {"a": shared, "b": shared}
    utils = CreateObject("roUtils")
    utils.isSameObject(aa, aa)   ' returns true
    utils.isSameObject(aa, {})   ' returns false
    utils.isSameObject(aa.a, aa.b)  ' returns true

Queueing messages
Roku OS 15.0 provides a new roRenderThreadQueue node for queuing messages to be consumed by handlers on the render thread. This enables asynchronous communication between Task nodes and the render thread. Messages passed using this mechanism will not block the render thread like a rendezvous.
Message Handlers
Use the following syntax to define message handlers:
sub MyMessagehandler(data, msgInfo)

data contains the value that was passed into the PostMessage() or CopyMessage() functions.
msgInfo contains the metadata about the message, including the message ID and creation time

In general, handlers should be written to be as fast as possible to avoid dropping frames.
roRenderThreadQueue.AddMessageHandler(message_id as String, handler as String) as Object
Description
Registers a handler for messages received on the async message channel with the given message ID. The handler is called on the render thread for each message received.
You can register multiple handlers for a single ID. In this case, the handlers are called in the order they were registered.
This function can only be called on the render thread.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
message_id	String	The ID of the message channel to which this handler should be registered.
handler	String	The name of the handler function to be called for each message received.

Return Value
Returns an object that can be used to unregister the handler, if required.
roRenderThreadQueue.PostMessage(message_id as String, data as Object) as Void
Description
Posts a message to the queue. The data is moved and becomes unavailable to the calling thread. The call returns immediately and does not block the calling thread.
This function may be called from any thread.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
message_id	String	The ID of the channel to which this message should be posted.
data	Object	The contents of the message to be passed to any registered handlers. This must be recursively copyable. Non-copyable objects are ignored silently.
Copyable objects include: roAssociativeArray roArray integer, long integer string bool float, double invalid roSGNode

roRenderThreadQueue.CopyMessage(message_id as String, data as Object) as Void
Description
Posts a message to the queue. The call returns immediately and does not block the calling thread.
This function is similar to the PostMessage() function, but it copies data instead of moving it.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
message_id	String	The ID of the channel to which this message should be posted.
data	Object	Contents of the message that will be passed to any registered handlers.

roRenderThreadQueue.NumCopies() as Integer
Description
Returns the total number of objects for the channel that were copied by the PostMessage() function instead of being moved.
