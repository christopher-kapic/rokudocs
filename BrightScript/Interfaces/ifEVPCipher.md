ifEVPCipher
Implemented by
Name	Description
roEVPCipher	The EVP Cipher component provides an interface to the OpenSSL EVP library of symmetric cipher commands

Supported methods
Setup(encrypt as Boolean, format as String, key as String, iv as String, padding as Integer) as Integer
Description
Configures and initializes a new cipher context.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
encrypt	Boolean	True for encryption; false for decryption
format	String	Cipher format string, from openssl, listed at roEVPCipher
key	String	A hex-encoded key
iv	String	A hex-encoded initialization vector, which can be an empty string
padding	Integer	1 to use standard padding; 0 for no padding)

Return Value
Returns 0 on success or non-zero on failure.
Reinit() as Integer
Description
Reinitializes an existing cipher context. This can be called to reuse an existing roEVPCipher object to encrypt new data
Return Value
Returns 0 on success or non-zero on failure.
Process(bytes as Object) as Object
Description
Processes the included roByteArray containing encrypted/decrypted data.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
bytes	Object	An roByteArray containing data that is encrypted or decrypted.

Return Value
An roByteArray containing the result.
Example
  x = evp.Process(bytes)

is equivalent to
  evp.Reinit()
  x = evp.Update(bytes)
  x = x + evp.Final()

Update(bytes as Object) as Object
Description
Updates the included roByteArray containing encrypted/decrypted data.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
bytes	Object	An roByteArray containing data that is encrypted or decrypted.

Return Value
An roByteArray containing a subset of the result. Some or all of the result may not be returned until the next call to Update().
Final() as Object
Description
Signals that all data has been submitted by previous calls to Update().
Return Value
The last remaining encrypted or decrypted bytes.
