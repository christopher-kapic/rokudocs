roUrlEvent
The roUrlTransfer component sends the roUrlEvent with the following methods:
Supported methods
GetInt() as Integer
Returns the type of event, which may be one of the following values:
Event Type	Description
1	transfer complete
2	transfer started. Headers are available for suitable protocols. (Not currently implemented)

GetResponseCode() as Integer
Returns the protocol response code associated with this event. For a successful HTTP request this will be the HTTP status code 200. For unexpected errors the return value is negative. There are lots of possible negative errors from the CURL library but it's often best just to look at the text version via GetFailureReason().
The following table lists some of the potential errors (not all of them can be generated):

GetFailureReason() as String
Returns a description of the failure that occurred.
GetString() as String
For transfer complete AsyncGetToString, AsyncPostFromString and AsnycPostFromFile requests this will be the actual response body from the server. This method returns the string associated with the event.
GetSourceIdentity() as Integer
Returns a magic number that can be matched with the value returned by the roUrlTransfer.GetIdentity() method to determine the source of the roUrlTransfer event.
GetResponseHeaders() as Object
Returns an roAssociativeArray containing all the headers returned by the server for appropriate protocols (such as HTTP). Headers are only returned when the status code is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 300
GetTargetIpAddress() as String
Returns the IP address of the destination.
GetResponseHeadersArray() as Object
This method returns an roArray of roAssociativeArrays , where each associative array contains a single header name/value pair. Use this function if you need access to duplicate headers, since GetResponseHeaders() returns only the last name/value pair for a given name. All headers are returned regardless of the status code
