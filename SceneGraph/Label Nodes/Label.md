Label
Extends LabelBase

As of Roku OS 10.5, the Label node inherits most of its functionality from LabelBase node class. Developers, however, do not need to update their app code to account for this refactoring.

The Label node class is used to display a string of text.

Example
The following example shows a text layout derived from the Label node.

roku815px - label-node-sample

The following displays the text string "Application Development Made Easy!" in the medium bold system font near the left top of the display screen.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>

Fields
Fields derived from the Group and LabelBase classes can be used.

Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
font	Font	system default	READ_WRITE	Specifies the Font node to be used
lineSpacing	float		READ_WRITE	If the text is displayed on more than one line, specifies the amount of additional space added between lines
truncateOnDelimiter	string		READ_WRITE	If the width field value is greater than zero, provides a set of characters that are used to determine how to truncate the last line of text that is displayed if it extends beyond the specified width. If none of the characters in the last line of text are included in the truncateOnDelimiter field value string, the entire last line is not displayed. When the value is set to a non-empty string, the ellipsizeOnBoundary field value is ignored
leadingEllipsis	boolean	false	READ_WRITE	Specifies whether to display the end or beginning of text that overflows its available width:
true. The end of the text is shown. For example, "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" would be truncated to "...jumps over the lazy dog".
false. The start of the text is shown (for example, "the quick brown fox jumps...").
wrappedLines	Integer		READ_ONLY	indicates the number of wrapped lines in the label.
