DynamicKeyboard
Extends DynamicKeyboardBase

The DynamicKeyboard node is similar to the legacy Keyboard node, but with additional voice entry functionality. It enables text entry of alphanumeric and Latin characters, and voice entry of alphanumeric characters. It is typically used for entering email addresses or passwords.

The key layout is fixed based on the node's pre-built Key Definition File.
