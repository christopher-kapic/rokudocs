StdDlgDeterminateProgressItem
Extends StdDlgItemBase

Fields
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
percent	string	"0"	READ_WRITE	Specifies the current completion percentage text and graphic to be displayed (for example "35%" with more than a third of the indicator filled).

If this is set to a number less than 0 or greater than 100, the progress indicator will display "0%" or "100%" completion, respectively.
text	string	""	READ_WRITE	Specifies the text to be displayed next to the progress graphic. If the text width does not fit within the width of the content area, the text will wrap onto multiple lines.
