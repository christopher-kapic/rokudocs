ChannelStore
Extends Node

The ChannelStore node class provides an interface to the Streaming Store. It provides functionality equivalent to the roChannelStore component. In general, the ChannelStore node class allows developers to issue one of several commands, which involves the following steps:

Set the fields containing the data needed by the command (optional).
Set up an observer of the result field associated with the command.
Set the command field to the appropriate string to start the command execution.
The field associated with the command is set to a ContentNode object containing the results of the command.
Each of the commands starts a sequence of actions associated with the financial transaction that are handled by the Roku OS outside of control or monitoring by the app SceneGraph markup. The SceneGraph markup merely initiates the purchase and receives a final result.

Fields
command
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
command	string		READ_WRITE	Specifies the command to be executed:
getUserData
getUserRegionData ()
getCatalog and getStoreCatalog
doOrder
getPurchases and getAllPurchases
storeChannelCredData
getChannelCred
getDeviceAttestationToken
requestPartnerOrder
confirmPartnerOrder
requestedUserData
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
requestedUserData	string	all	READ_WRITE	Specifies the Roku customer account fields to be retrieved when the getUserData command is executed.

The default value is "all", which causes a ContentNode object to be returned from getUserData that includes all of the available Roku customer account information.

To request specific Roku customer account information items (for example, an email address, first name, and last name) set this field to a string containing a comma-separated list of values (for example, "email, firstname, lastname"). The available values are as follows:
email
phone
firstname
lastname
street
city
state
zip
country
birth
gender

In this case, the ContentNode object returned from the getUserData command includes the specified customer account information.
requestedUserDataInfo
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
requestedUserDataInfo	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Specifies whether the RFI screen is used for customer sign-ups or sign-ins. This may be one of the following values:
Field	Type	Default	Description
context	string	"signup"	Specifies the context of the RFI screen, which may be one of the following values:
"signup": The RFI screen displays a "Let's create your account" title and lists the customer information specified in the requestedUserData field. The RFI screen uses the "signup" context by default. See Sign-up requirements and best practices for more information on implementing the app sign-up UI.
"signin: "The RFI screen displays a "Sign in" title and lists only email or phone attributes, if specified in the requestedUserData field. Other attributes are ignored, even if specified. See the Sign-in example for how to use this field. See Sign-in requirements and best practices for more information on implementing the app sign-in UI.
forceShowData	Boolean	false	If true, the RFI signup screen displays the values of the requested customer information to be shared with the app (for example, Jone Doe, jon.doe@emailaddress.com).

By default, this flag is set to false, which means that the default RFI screen for the region is used. For example, in the US, the RFI screen displays the type of customer information being requested (email address, name, and so on).

This flag has no effect if the context field is set to "signin" (the RFI sign-in screen always displays the customer information values).

Example:
store = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ChannelStore")

' Doesn't show user data in dialog unless necessary in the user's region.
store.requestedUserData = "email,firstname,lastname,gender,birth"
store.command = "getUserData"

' Shows user data in dialog.
info = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ContentNode")
info.addFields({forceShowData: true})
store.requestedUserDataInfo = info
store.requestedUserData = "email"
store.command = "getUserData"
Sign-up example
store = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ChannelStore")

' Request several properties for sign-up
store.requestedUserData = "email, phone, firstname, lastname"
store.command = "getUserData"

' Store requested properties
 email = store.userdata.email
 firstname = m.store.userData.firstname
 lastname = m.store.userData.lastname
 phone = m.store.userData.phone
Sign-in example
store = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ChannelStore")

' Set sign-in context for RFI screen
info = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ContentNode")
info.addFields({context: "signin"})
store.requestedUserDataInfo = info

' Request user's email for sign-in
store.requestedUserData = "email"
store.command = "getUserData"

' Store requested properties
 email = store.userdata.email
userData
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
userData	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Contains the results of a getUserData command. The value stored in this field depends on whether the user clicks Continue or Cancel in the Request for Information (RFI) screen.

If the user clicks Continue, this field is populated with the Roku customer account information that was requested in the requestedUserData field.

If the user clicks Cancel, this field is set to "invalid".
order
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
order	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Contains the order to be filled when the doOrder command is executed. This ContentNode contains one child ContentNode for each of the items to be purchased. The child ContentNode must contain the following fields:
Field	Type	Description
code	string	Identifies the product to be purchased, as entered in the Product Identifier field on the In-App Product page in the Developer Dashboard when the product was created. See Creating an order for more information.
qty	Integer	The quantity of the item to be purchased, which is typically 1 for most in-app products.

This is only typically more than 1 if the product is a "packet" of identical items (such as game points, number of viewings permitted of some item of content, and so on).

To clear an order, set the order field to "invalid".

For upgrades/downgrades only. You need to include an action field to specify a subscription plan change.
Field	Type	Access Permission	Description
action	string	READ_WRITE	Set this to "Upgrade" or "Downgrade" to change the subscription plan from a previous purchase (for example, myOrder.action = "Upgrade"). The required values are case-sensitive; do not pass "upgrade" or "downgrade". See On-device upgrade and downgrade for more information.
Creating an order
To create an order, this field needs to be set to a ContentNode that has one child ContentNode for each item to be purchased. There are two approaches to setting the order field: setting it directly, or setting the deltaOrder field.

To set the order field directly, first create a ContentNode, then create one child ContentNode with the "code" and "qty" fields set for each item to be purchased. Assuming m.channelStore is a ChannelStore node object, the following Brightscript code shows how to do this:

myOrder = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ContentNode")
myFirstItem = myOrder.createChild("ContentNode")
myFirstItem.addFields({ "code": "UPC2397", "qty": 1})
mySecondItem = myOrder.createChild("ContentNode")
mySecondItem.addField({ "code": "UPC4321", "qty": 1})
m.channelStore.order = myOrder
The order field can be set indirectly as well, by setting the deltaOrder field to add or modify the desired quantity of an item. Assuming m.channelStore is a ChannelStore node object, the following results in the order field containing the same items as the previous example:

m.channelStore.deltaOrder = { "code": "UPC2397", "qty": 1}
m.channelStore.deltaOrder = { "code": "UPC4321", "qty": 1}
deltaOrder
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
deltaOrder	associative array	{}	WRITE_ONLY	Enables the order field to be populated incrementally. Each time this field is set, the order field is modified.

The deltaOrder associative array should contain a "code" string that identifies an available item, and a "qty" integer value to indicate how the children of the order field ContentNode should be modified.

For example, if the order is invalid, setting the deltaOrder field to the following associative array:

  { "code": "Merchandise1", "qty": 1 }

Would cause an order field to be set to a ContentNode, with one child ContentNode with a "code" field set to "Merchandise1", and a "qty" field set to 1.

If the deltaOrder field was then set to:

  { "code": "MyItem2", "qty": 1 }

The order field ContentNode would have a second ContentNode child appended to it, with the specified "code" and "qty" field values.

The "qty" field can be set to a negative value to remove an item from an order. For example, if the order field was set as above, and the deltaOrder field was set to:

  { "code" MyItem2", "qty": -1 }

The order field ContentNode would have the second child ContentNode removed.
requestPartnerOrder
See Creating TVOD apps for how to use this field for transactional purchases.

Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
requestPartnerOrder	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Specifies the product to be ordered from a TVOD app. The order contains the following fields:
Field	Type	Description
code	string	Identifies the product to be purchased, as entered in the Product Identifier field on the In-App Product page in the Developer Dashboard when the product was created. For TVOD-exclusive apps, a single in-app product may be used for all orders.

A TVOD-exclusive app only has transactional products such as movie rentals; it does not offer any subscription products.
priceDisplay	string	The original price of the product. Do not include a currency symbol (for example, set this to "3.99" instead of "$3.99").
price	string	The final price of the product, including any discounts. Do not include a currency symbol (for example, set this to "3.99" instead of "$3.99").
title	string	A description of the product (for example, the name of a rental movie).
couponCode	string	An alphanumeric string entered by the customer to receive a discounted price on the product.
contentKey	string	The publisher-specific SKU (or other unique identifier) for the product.
confirmPartnerOrder
See Creating TVOD apps for how to use this field for transactional purchases.

Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
confirmPartnerOrder	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Confirms the product being ordered from a TVOD app. The order contains the following fields:
Field	Type	Description
orderId	string	The orderID returned by Roku in the RequestPartnerOrderStatus content node.
code	string	The product identifier.
priceDisplay	string	The original price of the product. Do not include a currency symbol (for example, set this to "3.99" instead of "$3.99").
price	string	The final price of the product, including any discounts. Do not include a currency symbol (for example, set this to "3.99" instead of "$3.99").
title	string	The name of the product to be displayed on customers' invoices.
couponCode	string	An alphanumeric string entered by the customer to receive a discounted price on the product.
contentKey	string	The publisher-specific SKU (or other unique identifier) for the product.
orderStatus
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
orderStatus	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Contains the results of the doOrder command.
purchases
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
purchases	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Contains the results of a getPurchases or getAllPurchases command.
catalog
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
catalog	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Contains the results of a getCatalog command.
storeCatalog
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
storeCatalog	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Contains the results of a getStoreCatalog command.
requestPartnerOrderStatus
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
requestPartnerOrderStatus	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Contains the results of a requestPartnerOrder command.
confirmPartnerOrderStatus
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
confirmPartnerOrderStatus	ContentNode	invalid	READ_WRITE	Contains the results of a confirmPartnerOrder command.
fakeServer
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
fakeServer	Boolean	false	READ_WRITE	Enables a test mode for the ChannelStore node. The test mode disables communication by the ChannelStore node with the Streaming Store server, and it causes responses to asynchronous queries and operations to come from XML test configuration files rather than the server.

To use this test method, create a csFake folder and add the following XML files to it in order to simulate web service request and response data:
csfake/GetCatalog.xml: Simulates the list of products available for purchase in the app.
csfake/GetPurchases.xml: Simulates the list of products already purchased by the user.
csfake/PlaceOrder.xml: Contains information about the product to be ordered.
csfake/CheckOrder.xml: Verifies the validity of the order placed. For example, if the order and id values in the PlaceOrder and CheckOrder XML files do not match, the fake server will report an error in the order processing.


See the SimpleChannelStore sample app for how to use this testing method.

The fakeServer field must be set to false in a published app to allow actual In-App Product purchases by users.
It is recommended that developers use billing testing instead of the fakeServer.

Commands
Each of the actions associated with a command string are described in detail below.

getUserData
Displays the Roku Pay Request for Information (RFI) screen, which prompts customers to confirm that Roku may share their Roku customer account information with the calling app in order to sign up/sign in to that app. This enables apps to create and update customer accounts in their system without requiring customers to manually enter their personal information in an account creation screen.

To pass certification, all authenticated apps (SVOD, TVOD, other subscription services, and AVOD) must use the getUserData command to display a Request For Information (RFI) screen during the sign-up and sign-in workflows to enable customers to share their Roku account information with the app. Only if the user declines the request may apps require the customer to manually enter their information.

To use this command, follow these steps:

Set the requestedUserData field to the Roku customer account information to be requested. This may be set to either "all" to get all the available account information items, or a string with a comma-separated list of specific information items (for example, "email, firstname). Request the minimum amount of information required to create/update an account.

store = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ChannelStore")
store.requesteduserdata = "email, first name, lastname, phone"
Send the getUserData command.

m.store.command = "getUserData"
The RFI screen's asks the customer to use their Roku customer account information to sign up or sign in to the app, and it lists the requested information.

roku815px - signup-rfi-getuserdata-v2

roku815px - signin-2-rfi-splash

If the customer clicks Continue in the RFI screen to confirm that Roku can share their Roku customer account information with the app, the userData field field is populated with the Roku customer account information that was requested in the requestedUserData field. If the customer clicks Cancel in the RFI screen to decline sharing their information, the userData field is set to "invalid".

email = store.userdata.email
firstname = m.store.userData.firstname
lastname = m.store.userData.lastname
phone = m.store.userData.phone
Overall, the userData field field may contain the following Roku customer account information fields.

Field	Type	Description
firstName	string	The user first name
lastName	string	The user last name
email	string	The user email address
street1	string	The first line of the user street address
street2	string	The second line of the user street address

gender	string	

The user gender ("Male", "Female", or unspecified).
For authenticated free and AVOD apps that are not enrolled in the Roku Partner Payouts Program, the userData field contains a limited set of account information fields:

Sign-up RFI screen: email, phone, and zip.
Sign-in RFI screen: email and phone.
getUserRegionData
The getUserRegionData command retrieves the state, zip code, and country associated with the customer's Roku account. The location information returned by this command can be used to determine a customer's eligibility for regional-specific subscription products and content.

When this command is invoked, the ContentNode stored in the userRegionData field contains the following fields:

Field	Type	Description
state	string	The state associated with the customer's Roku account.
zip	string	The zip code associated with the customer's Roku account.
country	String	The country associated with the customer's Roku account.

trialCost	integer	If the product uses introductory pricing, the discounted price.
trialQuantity	integer	If the product uses introductory pricing, the number of months the discounted pricing is applicable.
trialType	string	Set to "months" for all products. All products using introductory pricing use "months" as the unit of time for the trial.
status	string	Indicates whether the product has been "saved" or "approved for sale".
purchaseDate	String	The subscription purchase date
getStoreCatalog
Lists the globally available In-App Products, which are available to all apps. When the command completes, the storeCatalog field is set to a ContentNode containing completion status. If successful, the storeCatalog field ContentNode has child ContentNodes for each available item. See the getCatalog command for the fields related to the product that are available in the child ContentNode.

doOrder
Displays the Roku Pay order confirmation screen, which is populated with information about the current order (product name, price, any free trial or discount offer). The customer can then either approve and complete the purchase, or cancel the purchase.

2: Interrupted
1: Success
0: Network error
-1: HTTP Error/Timeout
-2: Timeout
-3: Unknown Error
-4: Invalid request
If this command is successful, the orderStatus field ContentNode will have child ContentNodes for each item purchased. The fields for each child ContentNode include the same information when the getPurchases command is sent, but only the following fields are populated when the transaction is made:

Field	Type	Description
amount	string	Localized amount of the item purchased (post transaction) with local currency symbol
code	string	The product identifier, as entered in the Product Identifier field on the In-App Product page in the Developer Dashboard when the product was created.
purchaseId	string	The transaction ID
qty	integer	The quantity purchased
total	string	Localized total of the item purchased (including tax if applicable) with local currency symbol
As of Roku OS 9.4, if the back button is pressed from the Order Confirmation dialog, the doOrder command returns only a status of 2 ("interrupted"). Error handling in apps may need to be updated based on this behavior.

getPurchases
Returns the list of purchases of current subscription products associated with the Roku customer account.

When this command completes, the purchases field is set to a ContentNode containing the completion status.

Field	Type	Description
status	integer	Contains the command's completion status, which may be one of the following values:

This flag is set to "true" if the subscription is in the dunning state. In this case, check the status field to determine whether to grant the customer access to content:
If the status field is set to "Valid", the subscription is in a grace period and the viewer can access content.
If the status field is set to "Invalid", the subscription is on hold and the viewer cannot access content. If the viewer adds a valid method of payment, the subscription will be automatically renewed and the status will become "Valid".
name	string	The item name (this name will also be set as the description).
productType	string	The product type (ex. "MonthlySub")
purchaseChannel	string	Indicates where the Roku Pay subscription purchase was made:

trialType	string	Set to "months" for all products. All products using introductory pricing use "months" as the unit of time for the trial.
getAllPurchases
The getAllPurchases command is similar to the getPurchases command except that it requests the historical list of all canceled, expired, and terminated subscriptions over the lifetime of the current user account—in addition to the active subscriptions. You can use this method to leverage purchase history in order to implement subscription renewal flows and more easily determine if subscriptions have expired.

When this command completes, the purchases field is set to a ContentNode containing the completion status.

Field	Type	Description
status	integer	Contains the command's completion status, which may be one of the following values:
2: Interrupted
1: Success
0: Network error

storeChannelCredData
Stores an OAuth token, custom token, or other custom data, which you can then retrieve with the getChannelCred command (the token is stored in the channelCred.json.channel_data field). This data is stored securely in the Roku cloud and can be retrieved by other devices linked to the same Roku account. As a result, users do not have to re-enter their account credentials when setting up new devices associated with the same Roku account. For more information, see Automatic Account Link.

if billing is not enabled for the app, this field will include a string with a service error message.
status	Integer	An integer representing the request status. A successful request will return a status of 0.
getChannelCred
Retrieves an oAuth token, custom token, or other authentication artifact (channel_data), or a Roku Partner Unique Customer Identifier (roku_pucid) if the app is using the Roku single-sign on (SSO) authentication service for authenticating users. If successful, the ContentNode stored in the channelCred field represents the app credentials with the following fields:

Key	Type	Description
channelID	string	A string representing the app ID (ex. "2213" for Roku Media Player)
errorCode	string	A description of the service error (if any). This will be an empty string for a successful request.

Key	Type	Description
error	string	A string containing an error message (if any). This value will be null (uninitialized) for a successful request.
roku_pucid	string	An agnostic ID (in UUID format) representing the user. This value will be identical when retrieved in the same app across devices linked to the same Roku account.

If an app is storing an access token in the Roku cloud, this field does not contain a PUCID value.
token_type	string	Type of the returned token, e.g. "urn:roku:pucid:token_type:pucid_token"
channel_data	String	The access token, oAuth token, or other authentication artifact stored by the app in the Roku cloud via the StoreChannelCredData command.

This field is not returned if the StoreChannelCredData command is not used to store an artifact in the Roku cloud.

If the request fails, this json string will be empty.
publisherDeviceID	string	A unique identifier of the device.
status	integer	An integer representing the request status. A successful request will return a status of 0.
getDeviceAttestationToken
Generates a signed JSON web token (JWT) in the Roku cloud and returns it to the app. This token can then be used by the publisher's web services to verify that a message originated from a genuine Roku device. The following example demonstrates how to generate the device attestation token:

sub handleData(event)
  data = event.getData()
  print data.status
  print data.token
end sub

m.channelstore_node= m.top.findNode("deviceAttestationToken")
m.data.observeField("deviceAttestationToken", "handleData")
..
m.channelstore_node.nonce = GetHexString(16)
m.channelstore_node.command = "getDeviceAttestationToken"
Sample JWT

The following demonstrates a sample JWT that is returned to the app. Developers can use a JWT debugger to decode this token.

Verifying the JWT

To verify the JWT, developers must download the Roku device attestation token certificate and authenticate that the token is signed by that certificate (see https://jwt.io/introduction for more information on JWT verification methods). The decoded JWT contains the following fields

Decoded JWT

The decoded JWT contains the following fields:

"x-roku-attestation-data": {
    "nonce": "5E0692E0A389F4F6",
    "channelId": "dev",
    "developerId": "caa73fbb5e75a46a4b6114de51a5ada7d616e2ed",
    "timestampMs": 1656377873990
 }
requestPartnerOrder
See Creating TVOD channels for how to use this command for transactional purchases.

Checks the user's billing status for transactional purchases. This is a prerequisite for sending the confirmPartnerOrder command.

If this command is successful, the requestPartnerOrderStatus field contains the following values:

Field	Type	Description
orderId	String	The ID that must be included as a field in the confirmOrderInfo ContentNode used by the confirmPartnerOrder command.
status	String	Success
tax	String	Cost of tax (if applicable)
total	String	Total cost of transaction
If this command fails, the requestPartnerOrderStatus field contains the following values:

Field	Type	Description
errorCode	String	An error code representing why the transaction failed
errorMessage	String	An error message explaining why the transaction failed
status	String	Failure
confirmPartnerOrder
See Creating TVOD channels for how to use this command for transactional purchases.

This command is equivalent to the doOrder command for transaction purchases. The user's billing status must first be confirmed with the requestPartnerOrder command before sending this command.

If this command is successful, the confirmPartnerOrderStatus field contains the following values:

Field	Type	Description
purchaseId	String	The transaction ID
status	String	Success
If this command fails, the confirmPartnerOrderStatus field contains the following values:

Field	Type	Description
errorCode	String	An error code representing why the transaction failed
errorMessage	String	An error message explaining why the transaction failed
status	String	Failure
