Overview
The SceneGraph API includes several nodes to animate screen elements.
You can move screen elements around, make them disappear and reappear,
and change color. Animating screen elements requires the use of one of
the node classes derived from AnimationBase , which must include a
child interpolator node to actually achieve a specific animation effect.
The animation and interpolator node classes
are:
Animation
SequentialAnimation
ParallelAnimation
FloatFieldInterpolator
Vector2DFieldInterpolator
ColorFieldInterpolator

All animations require that you target a specific field of a specific
renderable node or group of renderable nodes. You must also start (and
stop, if wanted) the animation in BrightScript code by setting the value
of the animation control field.
The child interpolator nodes each operate on different types of target
node field values. The FloatFieldInterpolator node
class operates on target node field values of type float , which
includes the opacity and rotation fields. Use a FloatFieldInterpolator node
to fade the target node in or out of visibility, or to rotate the target
node. The Vector2DFieldInterpolator operates
on target node field values of type vector2d , which includes the translation and scale fields. Use a Vector2DFieldInterpolator node
to move the target node around the screen display, or to enlarge or
shrink it. The ColorFieldInterpolator node
class operates on target node fields of type color , so can be used to
change the color of a target node that includes a color field.
The child interpolator nodes each include two field arrays: key and keyValue . These two arrays must contain the same number of elements
in order for the animation to work. The key field array contains the
fractional values of the animation duration at which the target node
field value in the corresponding keyValue array position will be set.
The following summarizes how to achieve certain animation effects.
Effect	Interpolator	Target Field	Notes
Move	Vector2DFieldInterpolator	translation	You can move the element off the screen entirely, or over/under other elements at different z-order positions in the SceneGraph
Enlarge/Shrink	Vector2DFieldInterpolator	scale	Set the target scaleRotateCenter field to specify the point around which the element enlarges/shrinks
Fade-In/Out	FloatFieldInterpolator	opacity	The opacity field ranges in value from 1.0 (fully opaque and visible) to 0.0 (fully transparent and invisible) by setting the alpha channel of screen elements.
Rotate	FloatFieldInterpolator	rotation	Set the target scaleRotateCenter field to specify the point around which the element rotates
Change Color	ColorFieldInterpolator	color	The interpolator for the color field ranges through the HSV color space bounded by the low and high color values set in the keyValue field array. For example, if the low color value in the keyValue field array is set to the bottom of the HSV color space, and the high color value is set to the top of the HSV color space, the interpolator will range the animation throughout the entire HSV color space, with perhaps surprising (but not unpredictable) results. You should carefully choose the low and high key values to achieve a desired color animation result.

shows a number of animation types, including opacity, translation, and
color animations.
