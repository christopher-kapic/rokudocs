Node
The abstract base class of all SceneGraph nodes and the equivalent of the BrightScript roSGNode component. See roSGNode for supported interfaces.
Node class objects do not draw anything and are skipped in the render traversal of the SceneGraph node tree. The Node class provides the core parenting and key focus management functionality used by all nodes.
Fields
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
id	string	""	READ_WRITE	Adds a dictionary entry that allows the node to be retrieved with ifSGNodeDict findNode() function.
focusedChild	N/A	N/A	READ_WRITE	When a node or one of its children gains or loses the keyboard focus, the focusedChild field will be set and call its observer functions. In the observer function, typically, you use ifSGNodeFocus functions to query whether this node or some other node has the key focus or is in the key focus chain. Accessing the value of the field will result in script errors.
focusable	Boolean	false	READ_WRITE	Provides a hint as to whether or not this node can take the key focus.
change	associative array	{ Index1: 0, Index2: 0, Operation: none }	READ_ONLY	Operations affecting the set of children of a Node are recorded in this field if, and only if, this field has been observed. The field associative array indicates the operation and two indexes, index1 and index 2, involved in the change. The operation is denoted by these value strings: Value Meaning none No operation on the children nodes since the change field was observed, indexes are irrelevant insert A child node was inserted at index1 . If multiple child nodes were inserted (for example, via the insertChildren() function ), the last inserted child node is stored at index2 . add A child node was added to the end of the children node tree (at index 1 ). If multiple child nodes were added (for example, via the appendChildren() function ), the last added child node is stored at index2 . remove A child node was removed from position index1 , and if index2 > index1 , all the children nodes between index1 and index2 inclusive were removed set The child node at position index1 was replaced with a new child node clear All the children nodes were removed move The child node at position index1 was moved to the new position index2 setall All the children nodes were replaced modify A pre-defined content meta-data field of a ContentNode node child at index1 was changed ( only set for ContentNode node children when a pre-defined content meta-data field changes)	Value	Meaning	none	No operation on the children nodes since the change field was observed, indexes are irrelevant	insert	A child node was inserted at index1 .

Value	Meaning
none	No operation on the children nodes since the change field was observed, indexes are irrelevant
insert	A child node was inserted at index1 . If multiple child nodes were inserted (for example, via the insertChildren() function ), the last inserted child node is stored at index2 .
add	A child node was added to the end of the children node tree (at index 1 ). If multiple child nodes were added (for example, via the appendChildren() function ), the last added child node is stored at index2 .
remove	A child node was removed from position index1 , and if index2 > index1 , all the children nodes between index1 and index2 inclusive were removed
set	The child node at position index1 was replaced with a new child node
clear	All the children nodes were removed
move	The child node at position index1 was moved to the new position index2
setall	All the children nodes were replaced
modify	A pre-defined content meta-data field of a ContentNode node child at index1 was changed ( only set for ContentNode node children when a pre-defined content meta-data field changes)
