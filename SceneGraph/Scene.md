Scene
Extends Group

The Scene node class serves as the root of a SceneGraph node tree. Every roSGScreen object must have a Scene node, or a node that derives from the Scene node class as its root, including an XML markup component that extends the Scene node class or subclass. That node must be created using the roSGScreen createScene() function, with an argument that is a string of the name of the Scene node object created. For example:

screen = CreateObject("roSGScreen")
scene = screen.CreateScene("Scene")
While it is technically possible to have more than one scene per app, we recommend you only have one roSGScreen and one Scene node. Child nodes of the scene can be treated as different "scenes" where you can then implement transitions between them.

Fields
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
backgroundURI	uri	invalid	READ_WRITE	Specifies a graphic image file to be used for the Scene node background.
limitBackgroundToUIResolution	boolean	true	READ_WRITE	If the scene background URI is overridden with a non-theme value and this field is set to true, the backgroundURI image is limited to the current screen size after being loaded.

if this field is set to false, the backgroundURI image is loaded without any scaling applied.
backgroundColor	color	0x000000FF	READ_WRITE	Loads an image using the provided background URI as-is and does not apply any scaling whatsoever when "limitBackgroundToUIResolution" is false. Specifies a background color for the scene. This color is only used if the backgroundURI field is set to an empty string. For example:

scene.backgroundColor="0xEB1010FF"
scene.backgroundUri = ""
backExitsScene	Boolean	true	READ_WRITE	If true, a Back key press causes the scene to exit, back to the last user-focused item. If false, a Back key press does not cause the scene to exit. In order for the Back key to cause the scene to exit, the remote control focus must be explicitly set on the scene, or a child of the scene, using the ifSGNodeFocus interface setFocus(true) function. A Home key press always causes the scene to exit.
dialog	Node	invalid		Setting this field to a node extended from a Dialog node causes the dialog to be displayed
currentDesignResolution	assocarray		READ_WRITE	This read-only field is set when the Scene is initialized. It indicates which of an app's design resolutions (per manifest's ui_resolutions value) is being used, based on the player model and connected display type. Previously, a developer could deduct the same information by using both roDeviceInfo.GetUIResolution and roAppInfo.getValue("ui_resolutions"). This new field simplifies the process.

The field is set to an AA with two numeric-valued keys — width and height — as well as a string value indicating the current design resolution ("HD", "FHD" or "SD").

Brightscript Debugger> ? myNode.getScene().currentDesignResolution
<Component: roAssociativeArray> =
{
    height: 720
    resolution: "HD"
    width: 1280
}
palette	RSGPalette node	not set	READ_WRITE	Defines the default color palette used by those nodes that have a palette field (for example, the Scene node, standard dialogs, dynamic custom voice keyboards, and so on).

Apps typically set the Scene.palette field to consistently color the standard dialogs and keyboards in the app.

Nodes that include a palette field can be set to an RSGPalette node to override the default colors specified in the Scene node.

If a node that supports a palette does not set its palette filed, the node looks up the scene graph until it finds a node with its palette field set.

If no ancestor node is found with its palette field set, the default color palette is used (grey with white text).

The RSGPalette color values used by the Scene node are as follows:
Palette Color Name	Usages
PrimaryTextColor	The text color used for the entered text displayed in the VoiceTextEditBox node.
SecondaryTextColor	The text color used for the hints displayed in the VoiceTextEditBox.
InputFieldColor	The blend color applied to the VoiceTextEditBox background
DialogBackgroundColor	Blend color for dialog's background bitmap.
DialogItemColor	Blend color for the following items:
StdDlgProgressItem's spinner bitmap
StdDlgDeterminateProgressItem's graphic
DialogTextColor	Color for the text in the following items:
StdDlgTextItem and StdDlgGraphicItem if the namedTextStyle field is set to "normal" or "bold".
All content area items, except for StdDlgTextItem and StdDlgGraphicItem.
Title area. Unfocused button.
DialogFocusColor	Blend color for the following:
The button area focus bitmap.
The focused scrollbar thumb.
DialogFocusItemColor	Color for the text of the focused button.
DialogSecondaryTextColor	Color for the text of in the following items:
StdDlgTextItem and StdDlgGraphicItem if the namedTextStyle field is set to "secondary".
Disabled button.
DialogSecondaryItemColor	Color for the following items:
The divider displayed below the title area.
The unfilled portion of the StdDlgDeterminateProgressItem's graphic.
DialogInputFieldColor	The blend color for the text edit box background bitmap for keyboards used inside dialogs.
DialogKeyboardColor	The blend color for the keyboard background bitmap for keyboards used inside dialogs
DialogFootprintColor	The blend color for the following items:
The button focus footprint bitmap that is displayed when the button area does not have focus.
Unfocused scrollbar thumb and scrollbar track.
