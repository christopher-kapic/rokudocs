Panel
Extends Group
The Panel node is used to create sliding panels for app UI, similar to those in the Roku OS home screen.
Fields
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Use
panelSize	string	narrow	WRITE_ONLY	Write-Only
Specifies one of the default panel sizes. Setting the field causes the width and leftPosition fields to be set to values that match the RSG preferred layout for a panel of the specified size.

Value Meaning narrow Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a narrow Panel medium Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a medium width Panel wide Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a wide Panel full Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a full width Panel

Note that PanelSet usage mandates that whenever two Panels are visible, they should include either one narrow and one wide panel or two medium width panels. If one Panel is visible, it's panelSize should be set to "full".	Value	Meaning	narrow	Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a narrow Panel	medium	Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a medium width Panel	wide	Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a wide Panel	full	Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a full width Panel
Value	Meaning
narrow	Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a narrow Panel
medium	Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a medium width Panel
wide	Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a wide Panel
full	Set the width and leftPosition fields to the values for a full width Panel
width	float	388	READ_WRITE	Specifies the width of the panel in pixels. In most cases, this should be set by setting the panelSize field to one of the pre-configured settings.
height	float	-1	READ_WRITE	Specifies the height of the panel. In most cases, this will be set by the PanelSet and should treated as a read-only value.
leftPosition	float	105	READ_WRITE	Specifies the horizontal position of the panel relative to the left edge of the PanelSet (which is a the left edge of the display by default). In most cases, this should be set by setting the panelSize field to one of the pre-configure settings.
overhangTitle	string	""	READ_WRITE	When the panel is used as part of the OverhangPanelSetScene, setting the overhangTitle field will cause that text to be displayed as the title in the overhang when the panel slides into the left position of the PanelSet.
clockText	string	""	READ_WRITE	When the panel is used as part of the OverhangPanelSetScene, setting the clockText field will cause that text to be displayed instead of the clock in the overhang when the panel slides into the left position of the PanelSet.
optionsAvailable	Boolean	false	READ_WRITE	When the panel is used as part of the OverhangPanelSetScene, setting optionsAvailable will enable/disable the options button handling when the panel slides into the left position of the PanelSet. The overhang's options prompt will change appearance to provide feedback to the user that the options button is enabled/disabled.
leftOrientation	Boolean	false	READ_WRITE	When the panel is used as part of the OverhangPanelSetScene, leftOrientation will be set to true when the panel moves into the left position of the PanelSet and set to false when the panel moves into the right position of the PanelSet.
leftOnly	Boolean	false	READ_WRITE	The leftOnly field provides information to the PanelSet that this Panel should never appear in the right position of the PanelSet. When the panels are sliding back towards the home position (as a result of a Left or Back key press), and the panel slides into the right position, the PanelSet initiates another slide in the same back direction so that the panel does not end up on the right.
hasNextPanel	Boolean	false	READ_WRITE	The hasNextPanel field provides information to the PanelSet as to whether or not this panel has another panel to its right. If set to true, the PanelSet's right arrow indicator is displayed and pressing the right arrow button on the remote triggers the PanelSet to move the focus one panel to the right, sliding the Panels as needed to make sure the panel that has the focus ends up onscreen. If set to false, the PanelSet's right arrow indicator is not displayed and the right arrow button does not trigger any change to the focused panel.
isFullScreen	Boolean	false	READ_WRITE	The isFullScreen field indicates that this panel should be the only panel displayed (i.e. it will take up both the left and right positions in the PanelSet.
goBackCount	integer	1	READ_WRITE	Setting goBackCount field to a value greater than 1 causes the PanelSet to move the focus back that many panels when the user presses the left arrow button, sliding the Panels as needed to make sure the panel that has the focus ends up onscreen.
selectButtonMovesPanelForward	Boolean	true	READ_WRITE	When set to true, pressing the OK/Select button on the remote control causes the PanelSet focus to move to the next panel.
isOffscreenLeft	Boolean	false	READ_WRITE	This field is set by the PanelSet to indicate that the panel is positioned offscreen of the left edge of the PanelSet. This field is often observed to cancel outstanding load requests for images that are displayed on the panel.
