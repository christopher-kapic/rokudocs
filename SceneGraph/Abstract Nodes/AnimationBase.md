AnimationBase
Extends Node

AnimationBase is an abstract node class that contains the fields common to the Animation, SequentialAnimation, and ParallelAnimation nodes. The purpose of the AnimationBase node class is to provide the basic functionality needed to animate screen elements, such as moving them across the display screen, fading them in and out of view, or changing their color. All node classes extended from AnimationBase require the use of the interpolator node classes FloatFieldInterpolator, Vector2DFieldInterpolator, and ColorFieldInterpolator as child nodes to achieve a specific animation effect.

AnimationBase is not meant to be instantiated directly by app code

Fields
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
control	option string	none	READ_WRITE	Controls the animation. Supported options include:
Option	Effect
none	Initial state with no associated action
start	Always plays the animation from the beginning
stop	Stops the animation in its current state
pause	Pauses the animation in its current state
resume	If paused, resumes the animation from its current state. If the animation is not paused, plays the animation from the beginning.
finish	Jumps to the end of the animation, then stops. All animated fields will be immediately set to their final values as if the animation had completed.
state	value string	stopped	READ_ONLY	Indicates the state of the animation. Values include:
Value	Meaning
running	Indicates that the animation is in progress
paused	Indicates that the animation has been paused
stopped	Indicates that the animation has either run to completion or has been explicitly stopped
repeat	Boolean	false	READ_WRITE	Controls whether the animation stops when it finishes (false) or repeats from the beginning (true)
delay	time	0	READ_WRITE	Delays the start of the animation by the specified number of seconds
