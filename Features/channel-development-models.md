App development via the Roku SDK
Once you've begun hosting your content on the web , you'll next need to build your app from the ground up using the Roku SDK . The Roku SDK offers nearly endless UI and feature customization options, a suite of development tools, and a robust set of APIs for publishers. The Roku developer APIs enable you to build apps that include the following features:
Consistent cross-platform UI — You have complete control to mirror the UI of your application on other devices, creating a consistent experience for your end-users.
Enhanced engagement – Present your content to your users however you would like, be that through a recommended content carousel, a grid of content, or an EPG view.
DRM support — Secure your content through DRM encryption.
Billing — Monetize your users through a variety of billing models: Subscriptions, in-app transactions, or a one-time pay-to-install fee.
User authentication — Allow users to authenticate into their account to restore their preferences, bookmarked content, and better understand their streaming behaviors.
Third-party analytics — All Roku apps receive audience engagement reports from Roku to better understand how users are engaging with their content. In addition, you can integrate third-party analytics providers into your app, such as Google Analytics or Brightcove.
