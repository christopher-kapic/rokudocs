Overview
Apps have access to web-based app analytics and sales reports through Roku's
Developer Dashboard. This allows you to analyze your app's health, viewership trends, and metrics
for specific titles and devices. The following video highlights the different app analytics available to you.
As a service to our partners, Roku provides some basic analytics for all apps
on the platform in the form of standardized dashboards with metrics on
app health, viewership and engagement, and so forth.
Dashboards are read-only - meaning users cannot modify the dashboards themselves
(apart from applying filters), create new dashboards, or change any of the
underlying data.Also, the app data displayed are restricted to app owners.
You will never see data pertaining to apps other than your own,
and Roku will never share your app data with other app owners.
Roku evaluates making changes to the available dashboards on an ongoing basis,
based on feedback from our app partners.
Access to some dashboards may be restricted based on the size of the
business relationship.
In-app data Roku often differentiates between unique accounts and unique devices.
Roku generally considers unique accounts to be a better measure of audience size
and engagement metrics, while unique devices can be a more meaningful measure of
app health metrics such as crashes and buffering.
The reason for this is that once a user installs an app,
that installation will synchronize across all devices associated with that user's
account, potentially inflating installation counts relative to the actual number
of households with the app installed.
Reports also distinguish between "visitors" and "viewers" according to the following definitions:
A visitor is a user who has opened or started an app, but may not have streamed any content. Visitors are measured at the account level (a single account can be associated with multiple devices).
A viewer is a user who has streamed content in the app. A visitor can also be counted as a viewer, but not all visitors will be counted as viewers. Viewers are also measured at the account level.
Unique visitor and unique viewer counts depend on the time period of measurement, so adding up daily visitors over the course of the week will differ from taking a weekly visitor measurement because some accounts may visit an app multiple times per week.

Available reports in Developer Dashboard
Roku automatically generates the following app analytics and sales reports as Looker dashboards for your app (Looker is the business intelligence platform that Roku uses for providing app analytics):
Analytics:
Channel Engagement - installs, visits and streaming data for all apps
Channel Health - BrightScript crashes and buffering data for all apps
Viewership Summary - small selection of app engagement and app health data.
Channel Stability : BrightScript crashes and memory closures for all apps across all Roku device models.

Sales reports:
Transaction - records all in-app transactions for SVOD or TVOD apps, such as product purchases, free trial initiations, and returns
Sales Activity - displays daily transaction revenue totals by app, product, and currency within a window of up to one month
Payout Audit - assists with reconciliation between app revenue activity and payouts received from Roku
Tax Withholding - Breaks down how net payouts are calculated after Roku's revenue share, tax withholding, and currency conversion are applied to app gross revenue. Because apps differ in both business model and technical implementation, the relevancy of specific report and availability of data therein will vary. If a report does not pertain to your app type, it will not be made available to you.

App Analytics
To open an app analytics report in the Developer Dashboard, follow these steps:
Click Analytics in the left sidebar.
Click the tab for the report you want to view (the Channel Health report is selected by default).
Select the app you want to analyze from the drop-down list. Alternatively, you can click Public channels or Beta app and then click the analytics icon for the app or select an app and then click View analytics .

Sales reports
To open a sales report in the Developer Dashboard, follow these steps:
Click Sales reports in the left sidebar.
Click the tab for the report you want to view (the Transactions report is selected by default).
Select the app you want to analyze from the drop-down list.

Updating and saving reports
In each report's upper-right corner you have options for updating and saving the report.
Click Run to refresh the report. Near Run the time since the last refresh is displayed. Reports must be refreshed after changing the filters.
Click the gear icon in the upper-right corner to download the report to a PDF file or CSVs in a zip file.

Filtering reports
All reports contain a FILTERS section at the top where you can select the app data to be displayed, such as specifying a particular Time Period. You cannot add new filters but you can set some filters to "null" or "blank" to include all available data. A mismatch in filters can also return uninterpretable results, such as would be the case if you set the Time Period to be shorter than the Time Grain (e.g. a one week Time Period and month Time Grain).
Dashboards may contain several sections and changing filters will cause some sections to update the values displayed while others may not. This depends on what is being measured and how it relates to the changed filter. For instance, total installs is a point-in-time measurement, so changing the Time Grain filter will not change the value displayed for that metric while changing the Time Period will. Users must click on the "Run" button to update values after changing a filter.
Information on available filters is also included in the discussion of individual dashboards, and not all of the same filters will be available on all reports. The most common filters include:
Time Period - Sets the data sample period for the entire report. Changing this filter changes measurements for the entire report. By default, Time Period is set to "8 days ago for 7 days" in most reports to include the most recent 7 complete day period; the most recent day is always an incomplete day.
Time Grain - Changing this filter changes the values of metrics with a time dimensions, such as visitors or viewers. The "day" Time Grain equates to a daily aggregate measurement, "week" to a weekly aggregate and "month" to a monthly aggregate. Any conflicts between Time Grain and Time Period (e.g. a Time Grain longer than the Time Period specified) will prevent data from displaying correctly.
Streaming Store Code - Identifies the code for a market , usually a country code, where your app can legally be distributed (i.e. made available for download to a Roku device). More than one code is allowed. Leave Streaming Store Code blank to include all markets where your app is currently published or enter one or more codes to display only data on specific markets.
Device Type - Available in the Channel Health dashboard, this filters data to specific types of Roku devices.

Exporting reports

Using Streaming Store codes
Streaming Store codes identify your app's market. Each code identifies a country or region where your app will be available for download. Be sure to only select a market where you have the legal right to distribute your app's content. For example, if your app can be downloaded only in the United States, choose US. If your app is available in more than one market, you can use more than one code. If no values are provided in the Streaming Store Code filter, then all markets will be included.
Each Streaming Store code consists of two or more letters, such as "US" for United States or "FR" for France. For example:
AR - Argentina
BR - Brazil
CA - Canada
CL - Chile
CO - Colombia
CR - Costa Rica
DE - Germany
FR - France
GB - United Kingdom
GT - Guatemala
HN - Honduras
IE - Ireland
MX - Mexico
NI - Nicaragua
OT - Rest of the world
PA - Panama
PE - Peru
SKYIE - Sky Ireland
SKYUK - Sky United Kingdom
SV - El Salvador
US - United States

In Developer Dashboard you can find out which countries your app has been published in by navigating to Manage My Channels > Preview and Publish > Properties .
