Payout Audit Report
The Payout Audit Report displays information, including monthly transaction amounts and deferred payouts, which partners can use to reconcile their apps' revenue activity with receipts from Roku Accounts Payable. Revenue events are expressed using the currencies originally involved. Both net revenue share and original amounts collected by Roku are reported.

To open the Payout Audit Report, go to the Developer Dashboard , click Sales reports in the left sidebar, click the Payout Audit tab, and then select the app for which you want to view the transactions and payouts.

The Payout Audit Report displays only a tabular grid, in which each row represents an individual transaction. Each row includes the following columns:

Charge A successful purchase transaction (historically used to indicate purchases under Roku as Payment Method: RPM). DowngradeCancel A successful downgrade transaction's cancellation of the outgoing (base) subscription. DowngradeSale A successful downgrade transaction's sale of a new (downgraded) subscription, to replace the outgoing (base) plan. Purchase A successful purchase transaction (historically used to indicate purchases under Roku Standard Billing: RSB). Such transactions include 1) one-time purchases. and 2) initial and recurring subscription charges.

For apps in the Germany Streaming Store only, a SEPA chargeback may occur when the customer disputes a transaction made through Roku Pay that results in a chargeback or their bank account has insufficient funds. ChargebackReversed Roku successfully reversed the chargeback claim. The revenue share will be returned to the partner payout. SecondChargeback The customer's bank has disputed the chargeback reversal on the transaction (this may occur if the customer provided new information, the chargeback reason changed, or the bank determined that the information provided by Roku was not sufficient to refute the chargeback). The transaction will be deducted from the partner's payout.

Using the Payout Audit Report to reconcile app activity with Roku payments
When reconciling the amount paid by Roku for a given month with the app transactions for that month, we recommend the steps below:
Run the report for your chosen Payout Month.
Export the data to a spreadsheet file. (See "Exporting report data," below.) Then open the file in your spreadsheet program.
In a freestanding blank cell, compute the total of the Partner Rev Share column. This should match Roku's payment (after accounting for exceptional circumstances, such as a withholding obligation).
Remember that the Partner Rev Share is always reported in the local Currency , but Roku pays in usd. So the final step of payment reconciliation is to convert the total from the local currency to usd.

To determine the portion of the month's payment which is caused by deferred amounts, only include in the total those Partner Rev Share amounts where the New or Deferred column contains "deferred". Similarly, the portion of the month's payment that results from new transactions will be the total of Partner Rev Share amounts where the New or Deferred column contains "new".
Withholding? Non-US developers please note: Once you have followed the above procedure, should the total of new revenue plus deferred revenue for the selected interval be significantly greater than the Roku payments made for that period, check to see if there is a locally imposed or other kind of external tax, which Roku is obliged to withhold. If so, adding that amount to the corresponding payment from Roku should yield the total of new and deferred revenue, as shown in the Payout Audit report.
