Roku platform overview
Roku is an open streaming platform that is revolutionizing how consumers watch video content. Roku is at the forefront of the streaming age, having pioneered video streaming in the United States and rapidly expanding its reach across the globe. Roku produces award-winning streaming players and soundbars , and has developed what is now the #1 selling smart TV streaming OS in the US, Canada, and Mexico 1 .
