Events (webinars, Developer Summit)
Platform updates (OS releases, developer tool updates, beta program announcements)
Business updates (tax and billing updates, monetization policy, regulatory compliance)

To set your developer program email preferences, go to the Roku Launchpad and click Email Preferences . You can also click the Email Preferences link in the footer of any Roku Developer's email. You then select the checkboxes for the notifications you want to receive and click Save preferences .
