Introduction to the Roku search feed specification
Apps can participate in Roku Search to make their content more discoverable to customers looking for content to watch. This gives publishers an opportunity to convert searches into subscriptions and rentals, drive users to their apps, and increase engagement.
To integrate into Roku Search, apps must provide the URL of their search feed , which is a JSON file that contains a unique ID and metadata for each video in the app's catalog. The search feed must conform to Roku's schemas and be validated by Roku. Once the feed passes validation, content metadata is added to the Roku Search master database.
When a customer uses their Roku remote control or Roku mobile app to enter or say their search, Roku Search automatically lists content from participating apps that matches the query.
