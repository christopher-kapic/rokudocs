Roku Search feed (JSON)
Channels participate in Roku Search by creating and submitting a search feed. The search feed is a single JSON file that includes the content metadata for an app's video catalog. Content meta data includes the unique ID, title, description, duration, rating, language, artwork, and so on. Once the feed has been configured following this spec, it can be submitted to Roku's feed validation tool , and the integration into Roku Search can then be completed.
The Roku search feed includes the following key features:
One feed for all regions . A single feed may contain region-specific content metadata and rating sources.

Content availabilty windows . A feed may include availability windows for individual content items.

Variety of content . The feed may contain the metadata for movies, television shows, and short-form content (for example, cooking videos, sports highlights, and so on).

Multiple source IDs . A single feed can contain both app-specific and Gracenote content source IDs.

Pagination
Pagination can be used to separate a single search feed into multiple discrete pages of smaller size (250MB maximum). This reduces the payload of the feed, which improves the performance of the publisher's and Roku's servers and optimizes the download frequency.
If the search feed is 20MB or larger, pagination should be used.
If a page within the search feed has not changed, Roku attempts to skip the downloading of it and use the previous download instead. To force a new download, update the ETag or Last-Modified header.
To use pagination in your search feed, follow these steps:
Separate the search feed into multiple pages (the maximum size for each page is 250MB).
In the paged response, set the nextPageUrl to the URL of the next page.
On the last page, do not set the nextPageUrl .
Roku downloads the pages in the search feed as long as nextPageUrl is in the paged response.

Schema
Developers can use the Roku Search feed schema to validate the format of their search feed (it, however, does not guarantee that a feed will be validated by Roku). This schema may occasionally be updated by Roku.
Some fields in the schema are for use by content providers onboarding content into The Roku Channel only.
