roPath
The roPath component provides developers an easy way to create valid file system paths.
The roPath component is a convenience class that implements ifString while providing additional validation and path inspection functionality. See File System for more information about valid path names.
This object is created with a string that represents the initial path:
CreateObject("roPath", "ext1:/vid")
Example
path = CreateObject("roPath", filename)
parts = path.Split()
if parts.phy = "tmp:" then print "this is a temp file"
if parts.extension = ".bmp" then print "this is a bitmap file"
