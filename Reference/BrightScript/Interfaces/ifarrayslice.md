Implemented by
Name	Description
roArray	An array stores an indexed collection of BrightScript objects. Each entry of an array can be a different type, or they may all of the same type.
roByteArray	The byte array component is used to contain and manipulate an arbitrary array of bytes

Supported methods
Slice([start_pos as Integer[, end_pos as Integer]]) As Object
Description
Returns a new array object with a shallow copy of the specified portion of the array.
The start_pos and end_pos fields specify the 0-based indices of items in the array, where the end_pos field represents the position past the last element to be copied.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
start_pos	Integer	The 0-based index of first element to copy. A negative index specifies an offset from the end of the array. The default value is 0.
end_pos	Integer	The 0-based index past last element to copy. A negative index indicates an offset from the end of the array. The default value is the array length.

Examples
'      0       1     2      3      4      5
arr = ["ape", "bat", "cow", "dog", "elk"]

' get the 3rd (index 2) and subsequent elements
arr2 = arr.Slice(2)
? FormatJSON(arr2)
' => ["cow","dog","elk"]

' get the 2nd (index 1) through 3rd (index 2) elements
arr2 = arr.Slice(1, 3)
? FormatJSON(arr2)
' => ["bat","cow"]

' get the last 2 elements
arr2 = arr.Slice(-2)
? FormatJSON(arr2)
' => ["dog","elk"]

' empty range
arr2 = arr.Slice(1, 1)
? FormatJSON(arr2)
' => []
