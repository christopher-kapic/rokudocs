ifArraySizeInfo
Available since Roku OS 15.0
The ifArraySizeInfo() interface includes set of functions that provide developers with more control over array capacities. These functions reduce the memory overhead when using the ParseJSON() function on large JSON body data sets.
Implemented by
Name	Description
roArray	An array stores an indexed collection of BrightScript objects. Each entry of an array can be a different type, or they may all of the same type.

Supported methods
IsResizable() As Boolean
Description
Returns a flag indicating whether the array will automatically expand to store new items.
Return Value
A flag indicating whether the array will automatically expand to store new items.
Capacity() As Integer
Description
Returns the current storage capacity of the array (specifically, how many items could be stored without allocating additional storage).
The return value may be 0 if the array is empty and no storage has been allocated yet.
Return Value
An integer indicating the current storage capacity of the array.
Reserve(minSize As Integer) As Boolean
As of Roku OS 15.0, the roByteArray node does not support this function.
Description
Sends a request to allocate or increase storage capacity of the array to hold at least the specified number of items.
Parameters
Name	Type	Description
minSize	Integer	The specified number of items the array is to store.

Return Value
Returns true if the potential capacity update can hold the specified number of items. Otherwise, returns false if the array is not resizable or storage allocation fails.
The updated capacity of the array may be more than was requested if the extra capacity already existed or how storage was implemented.
ShrinkToFit() As Boolean
As of Roku OS 15.0, the roByteArray node does not support this function.
Description
Sends a request to free or decrease storage to the minimum needed to store the current number of items.
Return Value
Returns true unless the array is not resizable or storage reallocation fails.
The updated capacity of the array may be more than the exact number of items in it based on the storage implementation.
