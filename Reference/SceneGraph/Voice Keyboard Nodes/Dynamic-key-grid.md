DynamicKeyGrid
Extends Group
The DynamicKeyGrid node implements a grid of keys that are defined and organized in a Key Definition File . It is typically used in a subclass of the DynamicKeyboardBase node (DynamicKeyboard, DynamicPinPad, and DynamicMiniKeyboard) to display the string of characters entered via text or voice entry. It may also be used as an individual node.
Fields
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
keyDefinitionUri	uri	""	READ_WRITE	Specifies the Key Definition File to use to define the key layout metadata.
mode	string	""	READ_WRITE	Specifies the keyboard mode. When set, the value is used to select which Grid of each Section is used, based on the grid's mode as specified in the Key Definition File.
focusVisible	boolean	true	READ_WRITE	Enables the grid's focus indicator to be hidden. This option is typically used in PinPads to hide the entered characters.
horizWrap	boolean	false	READ_WRITE	Specifies whether the key grid uses horizontal wrapping.
true : A horizontal arrow keypress causes the focus to wrap from the key at the left (or right) edge of the grid to the key at the right (or left) edge. false : The horizontal arrow keypress is not handled by the DynamicKeyGrid node; it is propagated up the scene graph so that it can be handled by one of its ancestor nodes.
vertWrap	boolean	false	READ_WRITE	Specifies whether the key grid uses vertical wrapping.
true : A vertical arrow keypress causes the focus to wrap from the key at the top (or bottom) edge of the grid to the key at the bottom (or top) edge. false : The vertical arrow key press is not be handled by the DynamicKeyGrid node; it is propagated up the scene graph so that it can be handled by one of its ancestor nodes.
palette	RSGPalette node	not set	READ_WRITE	The RSGPalette node contains the set of color values used by this DynamicKeyGrid node. By default, no RSGPalette is specified; therefore, the RSGPalette colors are inherited from the ancestor nodes in the scene graph.

If the DynamicKeyboardBase node is used within a StandardDialog node, the following rules determine the color palette used by the keyboard:
If the palette field is set, the key grid uses it. If the palette field is not set, the key grid looks up the scene graph until it finds a PaletteGroup node with its palette field set. This may be found in a DynamicKeyboard node, a StandardDialog node, or the Scene itself. If no node has its palette field set, the key grid uses the default palette (gray background/white text).
The RSGPalette color values used by the DynamicKeyboardBase are as follows:
Palette Color Name Usages KeyboardColor Blend color for key background bitmap. PrimaryTextColor Text color used for non-focused keys.
Blend color for the icons of non-focused keys.
Text color for the label of focused key suggestion items. SecondaryItemColor Text color for disabled keys.
Blend color for the icons of disabled keys. FocusColor Blend color for the focus indicator.
Blend color for the background of key suggestion pop-us. FocusItemColor Text color for the label of the focused key.
Blend color for the icons of the focused key and the focus indicator in key suggestion pop-ups.
Text color for the labels of non-focused key suggestion items.	Palette Color Name	Usages	KeyboardColor	Blend color for key background bitmap.	PrimaryTextColor	Text color used for non-focused keys.

KeyboardColor	Blend color for key background bitmap.
PrimaryTextColor	Text color used for non-focused keys.
Blend color for the icons of non-focused keys.
Text color for the label of focused key suggestion items.
SecondaryItemColor	Text color for disabled keys.
Blend color for the icons of disabled keys.
FocusColor	Blend color for the focus indicator.
Blend color for the background of key suggestion pop-us.
FocusItemColor	Text color for the label of the focused key.
Blend color for the icons of the focused key and the focus indicator in key suggestion pop-ups.
Text color for the labels of non-focused key suggestion items.
keyFocused	string	""	READ	Specifies the appearance of a key when it receives focus, based on the key's strOut value.
If the key's strOut value (as specified in the Key Definition File) is non-empty, this field is set to the strOut value. If strOut is an empty string, this field is set to the key's label string.
keySelected	string	""	READ	Specifies the appearance of a key when it is selected, based on the key's strOut value.
If the key's strOut value (as specified in the Key Definition File) is non-empty, this field is set to the strOut value. If strOut is an empty string, this field is set to the key's label string.
jumpToKey	array of integers	N/A	WRITE	Jumps the grid to the key to the coordinates specified in the provided array. The array must contain a valid section, row and key index for the current keyboard mode. If the array specifies an invalid key, no jump occurs.
disableKey	string	""	WRITE-ONLY	Draws the key's label or icon with a disabled appearance and prevents the key from gaining focus.

If the key has focus when it becomes disabled, the focus is automatically moved to an adjacent key that is not disabled (the key above the disabled key is checked first, then the key below, to the right, and then to the left).

To disable/enable a key, set the respective field to the key's label or StrOut value as defined in the Key Definition File. For example, to disable the "backspace" key, which typically has a delete icon displayed on the keyboard, enter the following: m.keyboard.keyGrid.disableKey = "backspace".

Multiple keys may be disabled at any time by setting the write-only disableKey field once for each key to be disabled.
enableKey	string	""	WRITE-ONLY	Draws the key's label or icon with an enabled appearance and allows the key to gain focus.

To disable/enable a key, set the respective field to the key's label or StrOut value as defined in the KDF file. For example, to enable the "backspace" key, which typically has a delete icon displayed on the keyboard, enter the following: m.keyboard.keyGrid.enableKey = "backspace".

Multiple disabled keys may be re-enabled at any time by setting the write-only enableKey field once for each key to be enabled.
