StandardDialog
Extends Group
The StandardDialog node is the base for Roku's pre-built standard message, keyboard, pinpad, and progress dialogs. It can also be used directly with a custom dialog structure built with the StdDialogItem nodes.
Fields
Field	Type	Default	Access Permission	Description
width	float	0.0f	READ_WRITE	Sets the width of the dialog:
If set to 0, the standard system dialog width is used (1038 for FHD, 692 for HD). If the title or any button text is too wide to fit within the standard width, the dialog width will be automatically increased to show the full title or button text up to a preset maximum (1380 for FHD and 920 for HD). If set to greater than 0, the specified width is used as the overall width of the dialog.
height	float	0.0f	READ_WRITE	Sets the height of the dialog.

If this field is set to greater than 0, and the layout of the dialog for the specified width results in a dialog with a height less than the value of this field, the dialog layout is increased so that the dialog height matches the value of this field. In this case, the button area is moved to the bottom of the dialog and a blank region exists between the content area and the button area.
buttonSelected	int	0	READ_ONLY	Indicates the index of the selected button when the user selects one of the buttons in the button area.
buttonFocused	int	0	READ_ONLY	Indicates the index of the button that gained focus when the user moved the focus onto one of the buttons in the button area.
palette	RSGPalette node	not set	READ_WRITE	Sets the color palette for the dialog's background, text, buttons, and other elements.

By default, no palette is specified; therefore, the dialog inherits the color palette from the nodes higher in the scene graph (typically, from the dialog's Scene node, which has a palette field that can be used to consistently color the standard dialogs and keyboards in the app).

The RSGPalette color values used by the StandardDialog node are as follows:
